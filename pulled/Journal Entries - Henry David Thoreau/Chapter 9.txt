Chapter IX 1837-1847.

[This chapter consists of paragraphs (chiefly undated) taken from a
large commonplace-book containing transcripts from earlier journals.
Thoreau drew largely from this book in writing the "Week," and to a less
extent in writing "Walden." Passages used in these volumes (as far as
noted), and those duplicating earlier journal entries already printed
in the preceding pages, have been omitted. All the matter in the book
appears to have been written before 1847.]


     I was born upon thy bank, river,
     My blood flows in thy stream,
     And thou meanderest forever
     At the bottom of my dream.

This great but silent traveller which had been so long moving past my
door at three miles an hour,—might I not trust myself under its escort?

Consider how much the sun and the summer, the buds of spring and the
sered leaves of autumn, are related to the cabins of the settlers which
we discover on the shore,—how all the rays which paint the landscape
radiate from them. The flight of the crow and the gyrations of the hawk
have reference to their roofs.

Friends do not interchange their common wealth, but each puts his
finger into the private coffer of the other. They will be most familiar,
they will be most unfamiliar, for they will be so one and single that
common themes will not have to be bandied between them, but in silence
they will digest them as one mind; but they will at the same time be
so two and double that each will be to the other as admirable and as
inaccessible as a star. He will view him as it were through "optic
glass,"—"at evening from the top of Fesolé." And after the longest
earthly period, he will still be in apogee to him.

It [the boat] had been loaded at the door the evening before, half a
mile from the river, and provided with wheels against emergencies, but,
with the bulky cargo which we stevedores had stowed in it, it proved
but an indifferent land carriage. For water and water-casks there was
a plentiful supply of muskmelons from our patch, which had just begun
to be ripe, and chests and spare spars and sails and tent and guns and
munitions for the galleon. And as we pushed it through the meadows to
the river's bank, we stepped as lightly about it as if a portion of
our own bulk and burden was stored in its hold. We were amazed to find
ourselves outside still, with scarcely independent force enough to push
or pull effectually.

The robin is seen flying directly and high in the air at this season,
especially over rivers, where in the morning they are constantly passing
and repassing in company with the blackbird.

I have never insisted enough on the nakedness and simplicity of
friendship, the result of all emotions, their subsidence, a fruit of the
temperate zone. The friend is an unrelated man, solitary and of distinct
outline.

       *       *       *       *       *

Must not our whole lives go unexplained, without regard to us,
notwithstanding a few flourishes of ours, which themselves need
explanation?

       *       *       *       *       *

Yet a friend does not afford us cheap contrasts or encounters. He
forbears to ask explanations, but doubts and surmises with full
faith, as we silently ponder our fates. He is vested with full powers,
plenipotentiary, all in all.

All day the dark blue outline of Crotched mountain in Goffstown skirted
the horizon. We took pleasure in beholding its outline, because at this
distance our vision could so easily grasp the design of the founder. It
was a pretty victory to conquer the distance and dimensions so easily
with our eyes, which it would take our feet so long to traverse.

Notwithstanding the unexplained mystery of nature, man still pursues
his studies with confidence, ever ready to grasp the secret, as if the
truth were only contained, not withheld; as one of the three circles on
the cocoanut is always so soft that it may be pierced with a thorn, and
the traveller is grateful for the thick shell which held the liquor so
faithfully.

Gracefulness is undulatory like these waves, and perhaps the sailor
acquires a superior suppleness and grace through the planks of his ship

The song sparrow, whose voice is one of the first heard in the spring,
sings occasionally throughout the season, from a greater depth in the
summer, as it were behind the notes of other birds.

As the temperature and density of the atmosphere, so the aspects of our
life vary.

In this bright and chaste light the world seemed like a pavilion made
for holidays and washed in light. The ocean was a summer's lake, and
the land a smooth lawn for disport, while in the horizon the sunshine
seemed to fall on walled towns and villas, and the course of our lives
was seen winding on like a country road over the plain.[486]

       *       *       *       *       *

When we looked out from under our tent, the trees were seen dimly
through the mist, and a cool dew hung upon the grass, and in the damp
air we seemed to inhale a solid fragrance.

Communicating with the villas and hills and forests on either hand,
by the glances we sent them, or the echoes we awakened. We glanced up
many a pleasant ravine with its farmhouse in the distance, where some
contributory stream came in; again the site of a sawmill and a few
forsaken eel-pots were all that greeted us.[487]

       *       *       *       *       *

While we sail here we can remember unreservedly those friends who dwell
far away on the banks and by the sources of this very river, and people
this world for us, without any harsh and unfriendly interruptions.

At noon his horn[488] is heard echoing from shore to shore to give
notice of his approach to the farmer's wife with whom he is to take
his dinner, frequently in such retired scenes that only muskrats and
kingfishers seem to hear.

       *       *       *       *       *

If ever our idea of a friend is realized it will be in some broad and
generous natural person, as frank as the daylight, in whose presence
our behavior will be as simple and unconstrained as the wanderer amid
the recesses of these hills.

The hardest material obeys the same law with the most fluid. Trees
are but rivers of sap and woody fibre flowing from the atmosphere and
emptying into the earth by their trunks, as their roots flow upward
to the surface. And in the heavens there are rivers of stars and milky
ways. There are rivers of rock on the surface and rivers of ore in the
bowels of the earth. And thoughts flow and circulate, and seasons lapse
as tributaries of the current year.

Consider the phenomena of morn, or eve, and you will say that Nature
has perfected herself by an eternity of practice,—evening stealing over
the fields, the stars coming to bathe in retired waters, the shadows of
the trees creeping farther and farther into the meadows, and a myriad
phenomena beside.

Occasionally we had to muster all our energy to get round a point
where the river broke rippling over rocks and the maples trailed their
branches in the stream.

The future reader of history will associate this generation with the
red man in his thoughts, and give it credit for some sympathy with
that race. Our history will have some copper tints and reflections, at
least, and be read as through an Indian-summer haze; but such were not
our associations. But the Indian is absolutely forgotten but by some
persevering poets.

The white man has commenced a new era. What do our anniversaries
commemorate but white men's exploits? For Indian deeds there must be
an Indian memory; the white man will remember his own only. We have
forgotten their hostility as well as friendship. Who can realize that,
within the memory of this generation, the remnant of an ancient and
dusky race of mortals called the Stockbridge Indians, within the limits
of this very State, furnished a company for the war, on condition only
that they should not be expected to fight white man's fashion, or to
train, but Indian fashion. And occasionally their wigwams are seen on
the banks of this very stream still, solitary and inobvious, like the
cabins of the muskrats in the meadows.

They seem like a race who have exhausted the secrets of nature, tanned
with age, while this young and still fair Saxon slip, on whom the sun
has not long shone, is but commencing its career.

       *       *       *       *       *

Their memory is in harmony with the russet hue of the fall of the
year.[489]

For the Indian there is no safety but in the plow. If he would not be
pushed into the Pacific, he must seize hold of a plow-tail and let go
his bow and arrow, his fish-spear and rifle. This the only Christianity
that will save him.[490]

His fate says sternly to him, "Forsake the hunter's life and enter into
the agricultural, the second, state of man. Root yourselves a little
deeper in the soil, if you would continue to be the occupants of the
country." But I confess I have no little sympathy with the Indians and
hunter men. They seem to me a distinct and equally respectable people,
born to wander and to hunt, and not to be inoculated with the twilight
civilization of the white man.

Father Le Jeune, a French missionary, affirmed "that the Indians were
superior in intellect to the French peasantry of that time," and advised
"that laborers should be sent from France in order to work for the
Indians."

The Indian population within the present boundaries of New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut has been estimated not to
have exceeded 40,000 "before the epidemic disease which preceded the
landing of the Pilgrims," and it was far more dense here than elsewhere;
yet they had no more land than they wanted. The present white population
is more than 1,500,000 and two thirds of the land is unimproved.

The Indian, perchance, has not made up his mind to some things which the
white man has consented to; he has not, in all respects, stooped so low;
and hence, though he too loves food and warmth, he draws his tattered
blanket about him and follows his fathers, rather than barter his
birthright. He dies, and no doubt his Genius judges well for him. But
he is not worsted in the fight; he is not destroyed. He only migrates
beyond the Pacific to more spacious and happier hunting-grounds.

A race of hunters can never withstand the inroads of a race of
husbandmen. The latter burrow in the night into their country and
undermine them; and [even] if the hunter is brave enough to resist,
his game is timid and has already fled. The rifle alone would never
exterminate it, but the plow is a more fatal weapon; it wins the country
inch by inch and holds all it gets.

What detained the Cherokees so long was the 2923 plows which that
people possessed; and if they had grasped their handles more firmly,
they would never have been driven beyond the Mississippi. No sense of
justice will ever restrain the farmer from plowing up the land which
is only hunted over by his neighbors. No hunting-field was ever well
fenced and surveyed and its bounds accurately marked, unless it were an
English park. It is a property not held by the hunter so much as by the
game which roams it, and was never well secured by warranty deeds. The
farmer in his treaties says only, or means only, "So far will I plow
this summer," for he has not seed corn enough to plant more; but every
summer the seed is grown which plants a new strip of the forest.

The African will survive, for he is docile, and is patiently learning
his trade and dancing at his labor; but the Indian does not often dance,
unless it be the war dance.

In whatever moment we awake to life, as now I this evening, after
walking along the bank and hearing the same evening sounds that were
heard of yore, it seems to have slumbered just below the surface, as in
the spring the new verdure which covers the fields has never retreated
far from the winter.

All actions and objects and events lose their _distinct_ importance in
this hour, in the brightness of the vision, as, when sometimes the pure
light that attends the setting sun falls on the trees and houses, the
light itself is the phenomenon, and no single object is so distinct to
our admiration as the light itself.

If criticism is liable to abuse, it has yet a great and humane apology.
When my sentiments aspire to be universal, then my neighbor has an equal
interest to see that the expression be just, with myself.

     My friends, why should we live?
       Life is an idle war, a toilsome peace;
     To-day I would not give
       One small consent for its securest ease.

     Shall we outwear the year
       In our pavilions on its dusty plain,
     And yet no signal hear
       To strike our tents and take the road again?

     Or else drag up the slope
       The heavy ordnance of religion's train?
     Useless, but in the hope
       Some far remote and heavenward hill to gain.

The tortoises rapidly dropped into the water, as our boat ruffled the
surface amid the willows. We glided along through the transparent water,
breaking the reflections of the trees.

Not only are we late to find our friends, but mankind are late, and
there is no record of a great success in history.

My friend is not chiefly wise or beautiful or noble. At least it is not
for me to know it. He has no visible form nor appreciable character. I
can never praise him nor esteem him praiseworthy, for I should sunder
him from myself and put a bar between us. Let him not think he can
please me by any behavior or even treat me well enough. When he treats,
I retreat.[491]

I know of no rule which holds so true as that we are always paid
for our suspicion by finding what we suspect. There can be no fairer
recompense than this. Our suspicions exercise a demoniacal power over
the subject of them. By some obscure law of influence, when we are
perhaps unconsciously the subject of another's suspicion, we feel a
strong impulse, even when it is contrary to our nature, to do that which
he expects but reprobates.

       *       *       *       *       *

No man seems to be aware that his influence is the result of his entire
character, both that which is subject and that which is superior to
his understanding, and what he really means or intends it is not in his
power to explain or offer an apology for.

       *       *       *       *       *

No man was ever party to a secure and settled friendship. It is no
more a constant phenomenon than meteors and lightning. It is a war of
positions, of silent tactics.

     I mark the summer's swift decline;
     The springing sward its grave-clothes weaves.[492]

     Oh, could I catch the sounds remote!
     Could I but tell to human ear
     The strains which on the breezes float
     And sing the requiem of the dying year!

_Sept. 29, 1842._ To-day the lark sings again down in the meadow, and
the robin peeps, and the bluebirds, old and young, have revisited their
box, as if they would fain repeat the summer without the intervention
of winter, if Nature would let them.

_Oct. 7, 1842._ A little girl has just brought me a purple finch or
American linnet. These birds are now moving south. It reminds me of the
pine and spruce, and the juniper and cedar on whose berries it feeds.
It has the crimson hues of the October evenings, and its plumage still
shines as if it had caught and preserved some of their tints (beams?).
We know it chiefly as a traveller. It reminds me of many things I had
forgotten. Many a serene evening lies snugly packed under its wing.

Gower writes like a man of common sense and good parts who has
undertaken with steady, rather than high, purpose to do narrative with
rhyme. With little or no invention, following in the track of the old
fablers, he employs his leisure and his pen-craft to entertain his
readers and speak a good word for the right. He has no fire, or rather
blaze, though occasionally some brand's end peeps out from the ashes,
especially if you approach the heap in a dark day, and if you extend
your hands over it you experience a slight warmth there more than
elsewhere. In fair weather you may see a slight smoke go up here and
there. He narrates what Chaucer sometimes sings. He tells his story with
a fair understanding of the original, and sometimes it gains a little
in blunt plainness and in point in his hands. Unlike the early Saxon
and later English, his poetry is but a plainer and directer speech than
other men's prose. He might have been a teamster and written his rhymes
on his wagon-seat as he went to mill with a load of plaster.

The banks by retired roadsides are covered with asters, hazels, brakes,

Facts must be learned directly and personally, but principles may be
deduced from information. The collector of facts possesses a perfect
physical organization, the philosopher a perfect intellectual one. One
can walk, the other sit; one acts, the other thinks. But the poet in
some degree does both, and uses and generalizes the results of both; he
generalizes the widest deductions of philosophy.[494]

_Oct. 21, 1842._ The atmosphere is so dry and transparent and, as it
were, inflammable at this season that a candle in the grass shines
white and dazzling, and purer and brighter the farther off it is. Its
heat seems to have been extracted and only its harmless refulgent light
left. It is a star dropped down. The ancients were more than poetically
true when they called fire Vulcan's flower. Light is somewhat almost
moral. The most intense—as the fixed stars and our own sun—has an
unquestionable preëminence among the elements. At a certain stage in the
generation of all life, no doubt, light as well as heat is developed.
It guides to the first rudiments of life. There is a vitality in heat
and light.

In many parts the Merrimack is as wild and natural as ever, and the
shore and surrounding scenery exhibit only the revolutions of nature.
The pine stands up erect on its brink, and the alders and willows fringe

My friend knows me face to face, but many only venture to meet me under
the shield of another's authority, backed by an invisible _corps du
réserve_ of wise friends and relations. To such I say, "Farewell, we

Among others I have picked up a curious spherical stone, probably
an implement of war, like a small paving-stone about the size of a
goose egg, with a groove worn quite round it, by which it was probably
fastened to a thong or a withe and answered to strike a severe blow like
a shotted colt. I have since seen larger ones of the same description.

These arrowheads are of every color and of various forms and materials,
though commonly made of a stone which has a conchoidal fracture. Many
small ones are found, of white quartz, which are mere equilateral
triangles, with one side slightly convex. These were probably small shot
for birds and squirrels. The chips which were made in their manufacture
are also found in large numbers wherever a lodge stood for any length
of time. And these slivers are the surest indication of Indian ground,
since the geologists tell us that this stone is not to be found in this
vicinity.

The spear-heads are of the same form and material only larger.

Some are found as perfect and sharp as ever, for time has not the effect
of blunting them, but when they break they have a ragged and cutting
edge. Yet they are so brittle that they can hardly be carried in the
pocket without being broken.

It is a matter of wonder how the Indians made even those rude implements
without iron or steel tools to work with. It is doubtful whether one of
our mechanics, with all the aids of Yankee ingenuity, could soon learn
to copy one of the thousands under our feet. It is well known the art of
making flints with a cold chisel, as practiced in Austria, requires long
practice and knack in the operator, but the arrowhead is of much more
irregular form, and, like the flint, such is the nature of the stone,
must be struck out by a succession of skillful blows.

An Indian to whom I once exhibited some, but to whom they were objects
of as much curiosity as [to] myself, suggested that, as white men
have but one blacksmith, so Indians had one arrowhead-maker for many
families. But there are the marks of too many forges—unless they were
like travelling cobblers—to allow of this.

I have seen some arrowheads from the South Seas which were precisely
similar to those from here, so necessary, so little whimsical is this
little tool.

So has the steel hatchet its prototype in the stone one of the Indian,
as the stone hatchet in the necessities of man.

Venerable are these ancient arts, whose early history is lost in that
of the race itself.

Here, too, is the pestle and mortar,—ancient forms and symbols older
than the plow or the spade.

The invention of that plow which now turns them up to the surface marks
the era of their burial. An era which can never have its history, which
is older than history itself. These are relics of an era older than
modern civilization, compared with which Greece and Rome and Egypt are
modern. And still the savage retreats and the white man advances.

I have the following account of some relics in my possession which
were brought from Taunton [?] in Bristol County. A field which had been
planted with corn for many years. The sod being broken, the wind began
to blow away the soil and then the sand, for several years, until at
length it was blown away to the depth of several feet, where it ceased,
and the ground appeared strewed with the remains of an Indian village,
with regular circles of stones which formed the foundation of their
wigwams, and numerous implements beside.

Commonly we use life sparingly, we husband it as if it were scarce,
and admit the right of prudence; but occasionally we see how ample and
inexhaustible is the stock from which we so scantily draw, and learn
that we need not be prudent, that we may be prodigal, and all expenses
will be met.

       *       *       *       *       *

Am I not as far from those scenes, though I have wandered a different
route, as my companion who has finished the voyage of life? Am I not
most dead who have not life to die, and cast off my sere leaves?

It seemed the only right way to enter this country, borne on the bosom
of the flood which receives the tribute of its innumerable vales. The
river was the only key adequate to unlock its maze. We beheld the hills
and valleys, the lakes and streams, in their natural order and position.

A state should be a complete epitome of the earth, a natural
principality, and by the gradations of its surface and soil conduct
the traveller to its principal marts. Nature is stronger than law, and
the sure but slow influence of wind and water will balk the efforts of
restricting legislatures. Man cannot set up bounds with safety but where
the revolutions of nature will confirm and strengthen, not obliterate,

Every man's success is in proportion to his _average_ ability. The
meadow flowers spring and bloom where the waters annually deposit
their slime, not where they reach in some freshet only. We seem to do
ourselves little credit in our own eyes for our performance, which all
know must ever fall short of our aspiration and promise, which only we
can know entirely; as a stick will avail to reach further than it will
strike effectually, since its greatest momentum is a little short of
its extreme end. But we do not disappoint our neighbors. A man is not
his hope nor his despair, nor his past deed.[495]

But it is in the order of destiny that whatever is remote shall be

It is not to be forgotten that the poet is innocent; but he is
young, he is not yet a parent or a brother to his race. There are
a thousand degrees of grace and beauty before absolute humanity and
disinterestedness.

The meanest man can easily test the noblest. Is he embraced? Does he

I am sometimes made aware of a kindness which may have long since been
shown, which surely memory cannot retain, which reflects its light long
after its heat. I realize, my friend, that there have been times when
thy thoughts of me have been of such lofty kindness that they passed
over me like the winds of heaven unnoticed, so pure that they presented
no object to my eyes, so generous and universal that I did not detect
them. Thou hast loved me for what I was not, but for what I aspired to
be. We shudder to think of the kindness of our friend which has fallen
on us cold, though in some true but tardy hour we have awakened. There
has just reached me the kindness of some acts, not to be forgotten,
not to be remembered. I wipe off these scores at midnight, at rare
intervals, in moments of insight and gratitude.

     Thou drifting meadow of the air,
     Where bloom the daisied banks and violets,
     And in whose fenny labyrinths
     The bittern booms and curlew peeps,

I am amused with the manner in which Quarles and his contemporary poets
speak of Nature,—with a sort of gallantry, as a knight of his lady,—not
as lovers, but as having a thorough respect for her and some title to
her acquaintance. They speak manfully, and their lips are not closed by
affection.

     "The pale-faced lady of the black-eyed night."

Nature seems to have held her court then, and all authors were
her gentlemen and esquires and had ready an abundance of courtly
expressions.

Quarles is never weak or shallow, though coarse and untasteful. He
presses able-bodied and strong-backed words into his service, which
have a certain rustic fragrance and force, as if now first devoted
to literature after having served sincere and stern uses. He has the
pronunciation of a poet though he stutters. He certainly speaks the
English tongue with a right manly accent. To be sure his poems have
the[498] musty odor of a confessional.

     How little curious is man,
     Who hath not searched his mystery a span,
     But dreams of mines of treasure
     Which he neglects to measure,
     For threescore years and ten
     Walks to and fro amid his fellow men
     O'er this small tract of continental land,
     His fancy bearing no divining wand.
     Our uninquiring corpses lie more low
     Than our life's curiosity doth go;
     Our most ambitious steps climb not so high
     As in their hourly sport the sparrows fly.
     Yonder cloud's blown farther in a day
     Than our most vagrant feet may ever stray.
     Surely, O Lord, he hath not greatly erred
     Who hath so little from his birthplace stirred.
     He wanders through this low and shallow world,
     Scarcely his bolder thoughts and hopes unfurled,
     Through this low wallèd world, which his huge sin
     Hath hardly room to rest and harbor in.
     Bearing his head just o'er some fallow ground,
     Some cowslip'd meadows where the bitterns sound,
     He wanders round until his end draws nigh,
     And then lays down his aged head to die.
     And this is life! this is that famous strife!
     His head doth court a fathom from the land,
     Six feet from where his grovelling feet do stand.

What is called talking is a remarkable though I believe universal
phenomenon of human society. The most constant phenomenon when men or
women come together is talking. A chemist might try this experiment in
his laboratory with certainty, and set down the fact in his journal.
This characteristic of the race may be considered as established. No
doubt every one can call to mind numerous conclusive instances. Some
nations, it is true, are said to articulate more distinctly than others;
yet the rule holds with those who have the fewest letters in their
alphabet. Men cannot stay long together without talking, according
to the rules of polite society. (As all men have two ears and but one
tongue, they must spend the extra and unavoidable hours of silence in
listening to the whisperings of genius, and this fact it is that makes
silence always respectable in my eyes.) Not that they have anything to
communicate, or do anything quite natural or important to be done so,
but by common consent they fall to using the invention of speech, and
make a conversation, good or bad. They say things, first this one and
then that. They express their "opinions," as they are called.

By a well-directed silence I have sometimes seen threatening and
troublesome people routed. You sit musing as if you were in broad
nature again. They cannot stand it. Their position becomes more and more
uncomfortable every moment. So much humanity over against one without
any disguise,—not even the disguise of speech! They cannot stand it nor
sit against it.

Not only must men talk, but for the most part must talk about talk,—even
about books, or dead and buried talk. Sometimes my friend expects a
few periods from me. Is he exorbitant? He thinks it is my turn now.
Sometimes my companion thinks he has said a good thing, but I don't see
the difference. He looks just as he did before. Well, it is no loss. I
suppose he has plenty more.

Then I have seen very near and intimate, very old friends introduced
by very old strangers, with liberty given to talk. The stranger, who
knows only the countersign, says, "Jonas—Eldred," giving those names
which will make a title good in a court of law. (It may be presumed
that God does not know the Christian names of men.) Then Jonas, like
a ready soldier, makes a remark,—a benediction on the weather it may
be,—and Eldred swiftly responds, and unburdens his breast, and so the
action begins. They bless God and nature many times gratuitously, and
part mutually well pleased, leaving their cards. They did not happen to
be present at each other's christening.

Sometimes I have listened so attentively and with so much interest
to the whole expression of a man that I did not hear one word he was
saying, and saying too with the more vivacity observing my attention.

But a man may be an object of interest to me though his tongue is pulled
out by the roots.

Scholars have for the most part a diseased way of looking at the world.
They mean by it a few cities and unfortunate assemblies of men and
women, who might all be concealed in the grass of the prairies. They
describe this world as old or new, healthy or diseased, according to the
state of their libraries,—a little dust more or less on their shelves.
When I go abroad from under this shingle or slate roof, I find several

As with two eyes we see and with two ears we hear, with the like
advantage is man added to man. Making no complaint, offering no
encouragement, one human being is made aware of the neighboring
and contemporaneous existence of another. Such is the tenderness of
friendship. We never recognize each other as finite and imperfect
beings, but with a smile and as strangers. My intercourse with men is
governed by the same laws with my intercourse with nature.

I hold in my hands a recent volume of essays and poems, in its outward
aspect like the thousands which the press sends forth, and, if the gods
permitted their own inspiration to be breathed in vain, this might be
forgotten in the mass, but the accents of truth are as sure to be heard
on earth as in heaven. The more I read it the more I am impressed by its
sincerity, its depth and grandeur. It already seems ancient and has lost
the traces of its modern birth. It is an evidence of many virtues in the
writer. More serenely and humbly confident, this man has listened to the
inspiration which all may hear, and with greater fidelity reported it.
It is therefore a true prophecy, and shall at length come to pass. It
has the grandeur of the Greek tragedy, or rather its Hebrew original,
yet it is not necessarily referred to any form of faith. The slumbering,
heavy depth of its sentences is perhaps without recent parallel. It
lies like the sward in its native pasture, where its roots are never
disturbed, and not spread over a sandy embankment.

     On fields o'er which the reaper's hand has passed,
     Lit by the harvest moon and autumn sun,
     My thoughts like stubble floating in the wind
     And of such fineness as October airs,
     There, after harvest, could I glean my life,
     A richer harvest reaping without toil,
     And weaving gorgeous fancies at my will,
     In subtler webs than finest summer haze.

In October the air is really the fine element the poets describe.[500]
The fields emit a dry and temperate odor. There is something in the
refined and elastic air which reminds us of a work of art. It is like
a verse of Anacreon or a tragedy of Æschylus.

I hate museums; there is nothing so weighs upon my spirits. They are the
catacombs of nature. One green bud of spring, one willow catkin, one
faint trill from a migrating sparrow would set the world on its legs
again. The life that is in a single green weed is of more worth than
all this death. They are dead nature collected by dead men. I know not
whether I muse most at the bodies stuffed with cotton and sawdust or
those stuffed with bowels and fleshy fibre outside the cases.

Where is the proper herbarium, the true cabinet of shells, and museum of
skeletons, but in the meadow where the flower bloomed, by the seaside
where the tide cast up the fish, and on the hills and in the valleys
where the beast laid down its life and the skeleton of the traveller
reposes on the grass? What right have mortals to parade these things on
their legs again, with their wires, and, when heaven has decreed that
they shall return to dust again, to return them to sawdust? Would you
have a dried specimen of a world, or a pickled one?

Embalming is a sin against heaven and earth,—against heaven, who has
recalled the soul and set free the servile elements, and against the
earth, which is thus robbed of her dust. I have had my right-perceiving
senses so disturbed in these haunts as to mistake a veritable living
man for a stuffed specimen, and surveyed him with dumb wonder as the
strangest of the whole collection. For the strangest is that which,
being in many particulars most like, is in some essential particular
most unlike.

It is one great and rare merit in the old English tragedy that it says
something. The words slide away very fast, but toward some conclusion.
It has to do with things, and the reader feels as if he were advancing.
It does not make much odds what message the author has to deliver at
this distance of time, since no message can startle us, but how he
delivers it,—that it be done in a downright and manly way. They come to
the point and do not waste the time.

They say that Carew was a laborious writer, but his poems do not show

After all, we draw on very gradually in English literature to
Shakespeare, through Peele and Marlowe, to say nothing of Raleigh and
Spenser and Sidney. We hear the same great tone already sounding to
which Shakespeare added a serener wisdom and clearer expression. Its
chief characteristics of reality and unaffected manliness are there.
The more we read of the literature of those times, the more does
acquaintance divest the genius of Shakespeare of the in some measure
false mystery which has thickened around it, and leave it shrouded in
the grander mystery of daylight. His critics have for the most part made
their [_sic_] contemporaries less that they might make Shakespeare more.

The distinguished men of those times had a great flow of spirits, a
cheerful and elastic wit far removed from the solemn wisdom of later
days. What another thing was fame and a name then than now! This is seen
in the familiar manner in which they were spoken of by each other and
the nation at large,—_Kit_ Marlowe, and _George_ (Peele), and _Will_
Shakespeare, and _Ben_ Jonson,—great _fellows_,—_chaps_.

Daniel deserves praise for his moderation, and sometimes has risen
into poetry before you know it. Strong sense appears in his epistles,
but you have to remember too often in what age he wrote, and yet that
Shakespeare was his contemporary. His style is without the tricks of
the trade and really in advance of his age. We can well believe that he
was a retired scholar, who would keep himself shut up in his house two
whole months together.

Donne was not a poet, but a man of strong sense, a sturdy English

or poetic phrase. He was rather _Doctor_ Donne, than the _poet_ Donne.
His letters are perhaps best.

My friend, thou art not of some other race and family of men;—thou art
flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone. Has not nature associated us in
many ways?[501] Water from the same fountain, lime from the same quarry,
grain from the same field compose our bodies. And perchance our elements
but reassert their ancient kindredship. Is it of no significance that
I have so long partaken of the same loaf with thee, have breathed the
same air summer and winter, have felt the same heat and cold, the same
fruits of summer have been pleased to refresh us both, and thou hast
never had a thought of different fibre from my own?[502]

It is as far from pity as from contempt. I should hesitate even to call
it the highest sympathy, since the word is of suspicious origin and
suggests suffering rather than joy. It was established before religion,
for men are not friends in religion, but over and through it; and it
records no apostasy or repentance, but there is a certain divine and
innocent and perennial health about it.

Its charity is generosity, its virtue nobleness, its religion trust. We
come nearer to friendship with flowers and inanimate objects than with
merely affectionate and loving men. It is not for the friend to be just
even,—at least he is not to be lost in this attribute,—but to be only
a large and free existence, representative of humanity, its general
court. Admirable to us as the heavenly bodies, but like them affording
rather a summer heat and daylight,—the light and fire of sunshine and
stars,—rather than the intense heats and splendors which our weakness
and appetite require.

Yesterday I skated after a fox over the ice. Occasionally he sat on his
haunches and barked at me like a young wolf. It made me think of the
bear and her cubs mentioned by Captain Parry, I think. All brutes seem
to have a genius for mystery, an Oriental aptitude for symbols and the
language of signs; and this is the origin of Pilpay and Æsop. The fox
manifested an almost human suspicion of mystery in my actions. While
I skated directly after him, he cantered at the top of his speed; but
when I stood still, though his fear was not abated, some strange but
inflexible law of his nature caused him to stop also, and sit again on
his haunches. While I still stood motionless, he would go slowly a rod
to one side, then sit and bark, then a rod to the other side, and sit
and bark again, but did not retreat, as if spellbound. When, however, I
commenced the pursuit again, he found himself released from his durance.

Plainly the fox belongs to a different order of things from that which
reigns in the village. Our courts, though they offer a bounty for his
hide, and our pulpits, though they draw many a moral from his cunning,
are in few senses contemporary with his free forest life.

TO A MARSH HAWK IN SPRING

     There is health in thy gray wing,
     Health of nature's furnishing.
     Say, thou modern-winged antique,
     Was thy mistress ever sick?


     In each heaving of thy wing
     Thou dost health and leisure bring,
     Thou dost waive disease and pain
     And resume new life again.

     Man walks in nature still alone,
       And knows no one,
     Discovers no lineament nor feature
       Of any creature.

     Though all the firmament
       Is o'er me bent,
     Yet still I miss the grace
       Of an intelligent and kindred face.

     I still must seek the friend
     Who does with nature blend.
     Who is the person in her mask,
     He is the friend I ask;

     Who is the expression of her meaning,
     Who is the uprightness of her leaning,
     Who is the grown child of her weaning.

     We twain would walk together
       Through every weather,
     And see this aged Nature
       Go with a bending stature.

     The centre of this world,
     The face of Nature,
     The site of human life,
     Some sure foundation

It is the saddest thought of all, that what we are to others, that we

If the Indian is somewhat of a stranger in nature, the gardener is too
much a familiar. There is something vulgar and foul in the latter's
closeness to his mistress, something noble and cleanly in the former's
distance. Yet the hunter seems to have a property in the moon which
even the farmer has not. Ah! the poet knows uses of plants which are
not easily reported, though he cultivates no parterre. See how the sun
smiles on him while he walks in the gardener's aisles, rather than on
the gardener.

Not only has the foreground of a picture its glass of transparent
crystal spread over it, but the picture itself is a glass or transparent
medium to a remoter background. We demand only of all pictures that they
be perspicuous, that the laws of perspective have been truly observed.
It is not the fringed foreground of the desert nor the intermediate
oases that detain the eye and the imagination, but the infinite, level,
and roomy horizon, where the sky meets the sand, and heavens and earth,
the ideal and actual, are coincident, the background into which leads
the path of the pilgrim.

All things are in revolution; it is the one law of nature by which order

How many young finny contemporaries of various character and destiny,
form and habits, we have even in this water! And it will not be
forgotten by some memory that we _were_ contemporaries. It is of _some_
import. We shall be some time friends, I trust, and know each other
better. Distrust is too prevalent now. We are so much alike! have so
many faculties in common! I have not yet met with the philosopher who
could, in a quite conclusive, undoubtful way, show me _the_, and, if
not _the_, then how _any_, difference between man and a fish. We are so
much alike! How much could a really tolerant, patient, humane, and truly
great and natural man make of them, if he should try? For they are to
be understood, surely, as all things else, by no other method than that
of sympathy. It is easy to say what they are not to us, _i. e._, what
we are not to them; but what we might and ought to be is another affair.

The character of this [the horned pout], as indeed of all fishes,
depends directly upon that of the water it inhabits, those taken in
clear and sandy water being of brighter hue and cleaner and of firmer

which has given it the name of the minister or preacher.

We read Marlowe as so much poetical pabulum. It is food for poets, water
from the Castalian Spring, some of the atmosphere of Parnassus, raw and
crude indeed, and at times breezy, but pure and bracing. Few have so
rich a phrase! He had drunk deep of the Pierian Spring, though not deep
enough, and had that fine madness, as Drayton says,

     "Which justly should possess a poet's brain."

We read his "Dr. Faustus," "Dido, Queen of Carthage," and "Hero and
Leander," especially the last, without being wearied. He had many of
the qualities of a great poet, and was in some degree worthy to precede
Shakespeare. But he seems to have run to waste for want of seclusion
and solitude, as if mere pause and deliberation would have added a new
element of greatness to his poetry. In his unquestionably fine, heroic
tone it would seem as if he had the rarest part of genius, and education
could have added the rest. The "Hero and Leander" tells better for his
character than the anecdotes which survive.

     I've seen ye, sisters, on the mountain-side,
     When your green mantles fluttered in the wind;
     I've seen your footprints on the lake's smooth shore,
     Lesser than man's, a more ethereal trace;
     I have heard of ye as some far-famed race,
     Daughters of gods, whom I should one day meet,
     Or mothers, I might say, of all our race.
     I reverence your natures, so like mine
     Yet strangely different, like but still unlike.
     Thou only stranger that hast crossed my path,
     Accept my hospitality; let me hear
     The message which thou bring'st.
         Made different from me,
       Perchance thou'rt made to be
       The creature of a different destiny.
     I know not who ye are that meekly stand
     Thus side by side with man in every land.
     When did ye form alliance with our race,
     Ye children of the moon, who in mild nights
     Vaulted upon the hills and sought this earth?
     Reveal that which I fear ye cannot tell,
     Wherein ye are not I, wherein ye dwell
     Where I can never come.
     What boots it that I do regard ye so?
     Does it make suns to shine or crops to grow?
     What boots [it] that I never should forget
     That I have sisters sitting for me yet?
     And what are sisters?
     The robust man, who can so stoutly strive,
     In this bleak world is hardly kept alive.
     And who is it protects _ye_, smooths _your_ way?

We can afford to lend a willing ear occasionally to those earnest
reformers of the age. Let us treat them hospitably. Shall we be
charitable only to the poor? What though they are fanatics? Their errors
are likely to be generous errors, and these may be they who will put to
rest the American Church and the American government, and awaken better
ones in their stead.

Let us not meanly seek to maintain our delicate lives in chambers or in
legislative halls by a timid watchfulness of the rude mobs that threaten
to pull down our baby-houses. Let us not think to raise a revenue
which shall maintain our domestic quiet by an impost on the liberty
of speech. Let us not think to live by the principle of self-defense.
Have we survived our accidents hitherto, think you, by virtue of our
good swords,—that three-foot lath that dangles by your side, or those
brazen-mouthed pieces under the burying hill which the trainers keep
to hurrah with in the April and July mornings? Do our protectors burrow
under the burying-ground hill, on the edge of the bean-field which you
all know, gorging themselves once a year with powder and smoke, and kept
bright and in condition by a chafing of oiled rags and rotten stone?
Have we resigned the protection of our hearts and civil liberties to
that feathered race of wading birds and marching men who drill but
once a month?—and I mean no reproach to our Concord train-bands, who
certainly make a handsome appearance—and dance well. Do we enjoy the
sweets of domestic life undisturbed, because the naughty boys are all
shut up in that whitewashed "stone-yard," as it is called, and see the
Concord meadows only through a grating.

No, let us live amid the free play of the elements. Let the dogs bark,
let the cocks crow, and the sun shine, and the winds blow!

     Ye do commend me to all virtue ever,
     And simple truth, the law by which we live.
     Methinks that I can trust your clearer sense
     And your immediate knowledge of the truth.
     I would obey your influence, one with fate.

There is a true march to the sentence, as if a man or a body of men were
actually making progress there step by step, and these are not the mere
_disjecta membra_, the dispersed and mutilated members though it were of
heroes, which can no longer walk and join themselves to their comrades.
They are not perfect nor liberated pieces of art for the galleries, yet
they stand on the natural and broad pedestal of the living rock, but
have a principle of life and growth in them still, as has that human
nature from which they spring.[506]

It is a marvel how the birds contrive to survive in this world. These
tender sparrows that flit from bush to bush this evening, though it is
so late, do not seem improvident, [but appear] to have found a roost for
the night. They must succeed by weakness and reliance, for they are not
bold and enterprising, as their mode of life would seem to require, but
very weak and tender creatures. I have seen a little chipping sparrow,
come too early in the spring, shivering on an apple twig, drawing in
its head and striving to warm it in its muffled feathers; and it had no
voice to intercede with nature, but peeped as helpless as an infant,
and was ready to yield up its spirit and die without any effort. And
yet this was no new spring in the revolution of the seasons.

Our offense is rank, it smells to heaven. In the midst of our village,
as in most villages, there is a slaughterhouse, and throughout the
summer months, day and night, to the distance of half a mile, which
embraces the greater part of the village, the air [is] filled with such
scents as we instinctively avoid in a woodland walk; and doubtless, if
our senses were once purified and educated by a simpler and truer life,
we should not consent to live in such a neighborhood.

George Melvin, our Concord trapper, told me that in going to the spring
near his house, where he kept his minnows for bait, he found that they
were all gone, and immediately suspected that a mink had got them;
so he removed the snow all around and laid open the trail of a mink
underneath, which he traced to his hole, where were the fragments of his
booty. There he set his trap, and baited it with fresh minnows. Going
again soon to the spot, he found one of the mink's fore legs in the trap
gnawed off near the body, and, having set it again, he caught the mink
with his three legs, the fourth having only a short bare bone sticking
out.

When I expressed some surprise at this, and said that I heard of such
things but did not know whether to believe them, and was now glad to
have the story confirmed, said he: "Oh, the muskrats are the greatest
fellows to gnaw their legs off. Why I caught one once that had just
gnawed his third leg off, this being the third time he had been
trapped; and he lay dead by the trap, for he couldn't run on one leg."
Such tragedies are enacted even in this sphere and along our peaceful
streams, and dignify at least the hunter's trade. Only courage does
anywhere prolong life, whether of man or beast.

When they are caught by the leg and cannot get into the water to drown
themselves, they very frequently gnaw the limb off. They are commonly
caught under water or close to the edge, and dive immediately with the
trap and go to gnawing and are quackled and drowned in a moment, though
under other circumstances they will live several minutes under water.
They prefer to gnaw off a fore leg to a hind leg, and do not gnaw off
their tails. He says the wharf rats are very common on the river and
will swim and cross it like a muskrat, and will gnaw their legs and even
their tails off in the trap.

These would be times that tried men's souls, if men had souls to be
tried; aye, and the souls of brutes, for they must have souls as well
as teeth. Even the water-rats lead sleepless nights and live Achillean
lives. There are the strong will and the endeavor. Man, even the hunter,
naturally has sympathy with every brave effort, even in his game, to
maintain that life it enjoys. The hunter regards with awe his game, and
it becomes at last his medicine.[507]

Carlyle's works are not to be studied,—hardly re-read. Their first
impression is the truest and the deepest. There is no reprint. If you
look again, you will be disappointed and find nothing answering to the
mood they have excited. They are true natural products in this respect.
All things are but once, and never repeated. The first faint blushes
of the morning gilding the mountain-tops, with the pale phosphorus
and saffron-colored clouds,—they verily transport us to the morning of
creation; but what avails it to travel eastward, or look again there an
hour hence. We should be as far in the day ourselves, mounting toward
our meridian. There is no _double entendre_ for the alert reader; in
fact the work was designed for such complete success that it serves
but for a single occasion. It is the luxury of wealth and art when for
every deed its own instrument is manufactured. The knife which sliced
the bread of Jove ceased to be a knife when that service was rendered.

To purify our lives requires simply to weed out what is foul and noxious

Nature and human life are as various to our several experiences as
our constitutions are various. Who shall say what prospect life offers
to another? Could a greater miracle take place than if we should look
through each other's eyes for an instant? We should live in all the ages
of the world in an hour,—aye, in all the worlds of the ages. What I have
read of rhapsodists, of the primitive poets, Argonautic expeditions,
the life of demigods and heroes, Eleusinian mysteries, etc., suggests
nothing so ineffably grand and informing as this would be.

I require of any lecturer that he will read me a more or less simple and
sincere account of his own life, of what he has done and thought,—not
so much what he has read or heard of other men's lives and actions,
but some such account as he would send to his kindred from a distant
land,—and if he has lived sincerely, it must have been in a distant land
to me,—describing even his outward circumstances and what adventures
he has had, as well as his thoughts and feelings about them. He who
gives us only the results of other men's lives, though with brilliant
temporary success, we may in some measure justly accuse of having
defrauded us of our time. We want him to give us that which was most
precious to him,—not his life's blood but even that for which his life's
blood circulated, what he has got by living. If anything ever yielded
him pure pleasure or instruction, let him communicate it. Let the
money-getter tell us how much he loves wealth, and what means he takes
to accumulate it. He must describe those facts which he knows and loves
better than anybody else. He must not write on foreign missions. The
mechanic will naturally lecture about his trade, the farmer about his
farm, and every man about that which he, compared with other men, knows
best. Yet incredible mistakes are made. I have heard an owl lecture with
perverse show of learning upon the solar microscope, and chanticleer
upon nebulous stars, when both ought to have been sound asleep, the one
in a hollow tree, the other on his roost.

After I lectured here before, this winter, I heard that some of my

It has not been my design to live cheaply, but only to live as I could,

To determine the character of our life and how adequate it is to its
occasion, just try it by any test, as for instance that this same sun is
seen in Europe and in America at the same time, that these same stars

globe, and who knows how many and various inhabitants of the universe.

being _all_, or remaining a particle, in the universe.

The complete subjugation of the body to the mind prophesies the
sovereignty of the latter over the whole of nature. The instincts are
to a certain extent a sort of independent nobility, of equal date with

are perhaps the mind of our ancestors subsided in us, the experience of
the race.

A small sum would really do much good, if the donor spent himself
with it and did not merely relinquish it to some distant society whose
managers do the good or the evil with it. How much might be done for
this town with a hundred dollars! I could provide a select course of
lectures for the summer or winter with that sum, which would be an
incalculable benefit to every inhabitant. With a thousand dollars
I could purchase for this town a more complete and select library
than exists in the State out of Cambridge and Boston, perhaps a more

Men talk much of coöperation nowadays, of working together to some
worthy end; but what little coöperation there is, is as if it were
not, being a simple result of which the means are hidden, a harmony
inaudible to men. If a man has faith, he will coöperate with equal faith
everywhere. If he has not faith he will continue to live like the rest
of the world, whatever company he is joined to. To coöperate thoroughly
implies to get your living together. I heard it proposed lately that
two young men should travel together over the world, the one earning his
means as he went, the other carrying a bill of exchange in his pocket.
