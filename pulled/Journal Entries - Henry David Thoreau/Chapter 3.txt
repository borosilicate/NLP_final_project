Chapter III 1839.

THE THAW[49]

_Jan. 11._

     I saw the civil sun drying earth's tears,
     Her tears of joy, that only faster flowed.

     Fain would I stretch me by the highway-side,
     To thaw and trickle with the melting snow,
     That, mingled soul and body with the tide,
     I too may through the pores of nature flow.

     But I, alas, nor trickle can nor fume,
     One jot to forward the great work of Time,
     'Tis mine to hearken while these ply the loom,
     So shall my silence with their music chime.


THE DREAM VALLEY

_Jan. 20._ The prospect of our river valley from Tahatawan Cliff
appeared to me again in my dreams.

     Last night, as I lay gazing with shut eyes
         Into the golden land of dreams,
     I thought I gazed adown a quiet reach
       Of land and water prospect,
         Whose low beach
     Was peopled with the now subsiding hum
     Of happy industry, whose work is done.

     And as I turned me on my pillow o'er,
     I heard the lapse of waves upon the shore,
     Distinct as it had been at broad noonday,
     And I were wandering at Rockaway.


LOVE

     We two that planets erst had been
     Are now a double star,
     And in the heavens may be seen,
     Where that we fixèd are.

     Yet, whirled with subtle power along,
     Into new space we enter,
     And evermore with spheral song
     Revolve about one centre.


_Feb. 3._

     The deeds of king and meanest hedger
     Stand side by side in heaven's ledger.

       *       *       *       *       *

     'Twill soon appear if we but look
     At evening into earth's day-book,
     Which way the great account doth stand
     Between the heavens and the land.


THE EVENING WIND

     The eastern mail comes lumbering in,
     With outmost waves of Europe's din;
     The western sighs adown the slope,
     Or 'mid the rustling leaves doth grope,
     Laden with news from Californ',
     Whate'er transpired hath since morn,
     How wags the world by brier and brake,
     From hence to Athabasca lake.[50]


POETIZING

_Feb. 8._ When the poetic frenzy seizes us, we run and scratch with our
pen, delighting, like the cock, in the dust we make, but do not detect
where the jewel lies, which perhaps we have in the meantime cast to a
distance, or quite covered up again.[51]


_Feb. 9._ It takes a man to make a room silent.


THE PEAL OF THE BELLS[52]

_Feb. 10._

     When the world grows old by the chimney-side,
     Then forth to the youngling rocks I glide,
     Where over the water, and over the land,
     The bells are booming on either hand.

     Now up they go ding, then down again dong,
     And awhile they swing to the same old song,
     And the metal goes round at a single bound,
     A-lulling the fields with its measured sound,
     Till the tired tongue falls with a lengthened boom
     As solemn and loud as the crack of doom.


     Then changed is their measure to tone upon tone,
     And seldom it is that one sound comes alone,
     For they ring out their peals in a mingled throng,
     And the breezes waft the loud ding-dong along.

     When the echo has reached me in this lone vale,
     I am straightway a hero in coat of mail,
     I tug at my belt and I march on my post,
     And feel myself more than a match for a host.

     I am on the alert for some wonderful Thing
     Which somewhere 's a-taking place;
     'Tis perchance the salute which our planet doth ring
     When it meeteth another in space.


THE SHRIKE

_Feb. 25._

     Hark! hark! from out the thickest fog
     Warbles with might and main
     The fearless shrike, as all agog
     To find in fog his gain.

     His steady sails he never furls
     At any time o' year,
     And, perched now on Winter's curls,
     He whistles in his ear.[53]


THE POET

_March 3._ He must be something more than natural,—even supernatural.
Nature will not speak through but along with him. His voice will
not proceed from her midst, but, breathing on her, will make her the
expression of his thought. He then poetizes when he takes a fact out
of nature into spirit. He speaks without reference to time or place.
His thought is one world, hers another. He is another Nature,—Nature's
brother. Kindly offices do they perform for one another. Each publishes
the other's truth.


MORNING

_April 4._ The atmosphere of morning gives a healthy hue to our
prospects. Disease is a sluggard that overtakes, never encounters,
us. We have the start each day, and may fairly distance him before the
dew is off; but if we recline in the bowers of noon, he will come up
with us after all. The morning dew breeds no cold. We enjoy a diurnal
reprieve in the beginning of each day's creation. In the morning we do
not believe in expediency; we will start afresh, and have no patching,
no temporary fixtures. The afternoon man has an interest in the past;
his eye is divided, and he sees indifferently well either way.


DRIFTING

Drifting in a sultry day on the sluggish waters of the pond, I almost
cease to live and begin to be. A boatman stretched on the deck of his
craft and dallying with the noon would be as apt an emblem of eternity
for me as the serpent with his tail in his mouth. I am never so prone
to lose my identity. I am dissolved in the haze.


DISAPPOINTMENT

_April 7. Sunday._ The tediousness and detail of execution never occur
to the genius projecting; it always antedates the completion of its
work. It condescends to give time a few hours to do its bidding in.


RESOLVE

Most have sufficient contempt for what is mean to resolve that they will
abstain from it, and a few virtue enough to abide by their resolution,
but not often does one attain to such lofty contempt as to require no
resolution to be made.


THE TEAMSTER

_April 8._ There goes a six-horse team, and a man by its side. He
has rolled out of his cradle into a Tom-and-Jerry, and goes about his
business while Nature goes about hers, without standing agape at his
condition. As though sixty years were not enough for these things! What
have death, and the cholera, and the immortal destiny of man, to do
with the shipping interests? There is an unexplained bravery in this.
What with bare astonishment one would think that man had his hands
full for so short a term. But this is no drawback on the lace-working
and cap-making interests. Some attain to such a degree of sang-froid
and nonchalance as to be weavers of toilet cushions and manufacturers
of pinheads, without once flinching or the slightest affection of the
nerves, for the period of a natural life.[54]


FAT PINE FOR SPEARING

_April 9._ Fat roots of pine lying in rich veins as of gold or silver,
even in old pastures where you would least expect it, make you realize
that you live in the youth of the world, and you begin to know the
wealth of the planet. Human nature is still in its prime, then. Bring
axe, pickaxe, and shovel, and tap the earth here where there is most
sap. The marrowy store gleams like some vigorous sinew, and you feel a
new suppleness in your own limbs. These are the traits that conciliate
man's moroseness, and make him civil to his fellows; every such pine
root is a pledge of suavity. If he can discover absolute barrenness in
any direction there will be some excuse for peevishness.


SOCIETY

_April 14._ There is a _terra firma_ in society as well as in geography,
some whose ports you may make by dead reckoning in all weather. All the
rest are but floating and fabulous Atlantides which sometimes skirt the
western horizon of our intercourse. They impose only on seasick mariners
who have put into some Canary Island on the frontiers of society.


CIRCUMSTANCES

_April 24._ Why should we concern ourselves with what has happened to
us, and the unaccountable fickleness of events, and not rather [with]
how we have happened to the universe, and it has demeaned itself in
consequence? Let us record in each case the judgment we have awarded to
circumstances.


ACQUAINTANCE

Cheap persons will stand upon ceremony, because there is no other
ground; but to the great of the earth we need no introduction, nor do
they need any to us.


THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH

_April 25._ If we see the reality in things, of what moment is the
superficial and apparent? Take the earth and all the interests it
has known,—what are they beside one deep surmise that pierces and
scatters them? The independent beggar disposes of all with one hearty,
significant curse by the roadside. 'Tis true they are not worth a
"tinker's damn."


PICTURE

_April 30._ Of some illuminated pictures which I saw last evening, one
representing the plain of Babylon, with only a heap of brick-dust in
the centre, and an uninterrupted horizon bounding the desert, struck
me most. I would see painted a boundless expanse of desert, prairie,
or sea, without other object than the horizon. The heavens and the
earth,—the first and last painting,—where is the artist who shall
undertake it?


_May 11._ The farmer keeps pace with his crops and the revolutions of
the seasons, but the merchant with the fluctuations of trade. Observe
how differently they walk in the streets.


VICE AND VIRTUE

_May 16._ Virtue is the very heart and lungs of vice: it cannot stand
up but it lean on virtue.

       *       *       *       *       *

Who has not admired the twelve labors? And yet nobody thinks if Hercules
had sufficient motive for racking his bones to that degree. Men are not
so much virtuous as patrons of virtue, and every one knows that it is
easier to deal with the real possessor of a thing than the temporary
guardian of it.


THE FORM OF STRENGTH

_May 17._ We say justly that the weak person is flat; for, like all flat
substances, he does not stand in the direction of his strength, that is
on his edge, but affords a convenient surface to put upon. He slides
all the way through life. Most things are strong in one direction,—a
straw longitudinally, a board in the direction of its edge, a knee
transversely to its grain,—but the brave man is a perfect sphere, which
cannot fall on its flat side, and is equally strong every way. The
coward is wretchedly spheroidal at best, too much educated or drawn out
on one side commonly and depressed on the other; or he may be likened to
a hollow sphere, whose disposition of matter is best when the greatest
bulk is intended.[55]


SELF-CULTURE

_May 21._ Who knows how incessant a surveillance a strong man may
maintain over himself,—how far subject passion and appetite to reason,
and lead the life his imagination paints? Well has the poet said,—

     "By manly mind Not e'en in sleep is will resigned."

By a strong effort may he not command even his brute body in unconscious
moments?


MY ATTIC

_June 4._ I sit here this fourth of June, looking out on men and nature
from this that I call my perspective window, through which all things
are seen in their true relations. This is my upper empire, bounded by
four walls, viz., three of boards yellow-washed, facing the north,
west, and south, respectively, and the fourth of plaster, likewise
yellow-washed, fronting the sunrise,—to say nothing of the purlieus and
outlying provinces, unexplored as yet but by rats.

       *       *       *       *       *

The words of some men are thrown forcibly against you and adhere like
burs.


RENCOUNTER

_June 22. Saturday._ I have within the last few days come into contact
with a pure, uncompromising spirit, that is somewhere wandering in the
atmosphere, but settles not positively anywhere. Some persons carry
about them the air and conviction of virtue, though they themselves are
unconscious of it, and are even backward to appreciate it in others.
Such it is impossible not to love; still is their loveliness, as it
were, independent of them, so that you seem not to lose it when they are
absent, for when they are near it is like an invisible presence which
attends you.

That virtue we appreciate is as much ours as another's. We see so much
only as we possess.


SYMPATHY[56]

_June 24._

     Lately, alas, I knew a gentle boy,
     Whose features all were cast in Virtue's mould,
     As one she had designed for Beauty's toy,
     But after manned him for her own stronghold.

     On every side he open was as day,
     That you might see no lack of strength within,
     For walls and ports do only serve alway
     For a pretense to feebleness and sin.

     Say not that Cæsar was victorious,
     With toil and strife who stormed the House of Fame;
     In other sense this youth was glorious,
     Himself a kingdom wheresoe'er he came.

     No strength went out to get him victory,
     When all was income of its own accord;
     For where he went none other was to see,
     But all were parcel of their noble lord.

     He forayed like the subtle haze of summer,
     That stilly shows fresh landscapes to our eyes,
     And revolutions works without a murmur,
     Or rustling of a leaf beneath the skies.

     So was I taken unawares by this,
     I quite forgot my homage to confess;
     Yet now am forced to know, though hard it is,
     I might have loved him, had I loved him less.

     Each moment, as we nearer drew to each,
     A stern respect withheld us farther yet,
     So that we seemed beyond each other's reach,
     And less acquainted than when first we met.


     We two were one while we did sympathize,
     So could we not the simplest bargain drive;
     And what avails it now that we are wise,
     If absence doth this doubleness contrive?

     Eternity may not the chance repeat,
     But I must tread my single way alone,
     In sad remembrance that we once did meet,
     And know that bliss irrevocably gone.

     The spheres henceforth my elegy shall sing,
     For elegy has other subject none;
     Each strain of music in my ears shall ring
     Knell of departure from that other one.

     Make haste and celebrate my tragedy;
     With fitting strain resound, ye woods and fields;
     Sorrow is dearer in such case to me
     Than all the joys other occasion yields.

     Is't then too late the damage to repair?
     Distance, forsooth, from my weak grasp hath reft
     The empty husk, and clutched the useless tare,
     But in my hands the wheat and kernel left.

     If I but love that virtue which he is,
     Though it be scented in the morning air,
     Still shall we be truest acquaintances,
     Nor mortals know a sympathy more rare.


THE "BOOK OF GEMS"

_July 4._

     With cunning plates the polished leaves were decked,
     Each one a window to the poet's world,
     So rich a prospect that you might suspect
     In that small space all paradise unfurled.

     It was a right delightful road to go,
     Marching through pastures of such fair herbage,
     O'er hill and dale it led, and to and fro,
     From bard to bard, making an easy stage;

     Where ever and anon I slaked my thirst
     Like a tired traveller at some poet's well,
     Which from the teeming ground did bubbling burst,
     And tinkling thence adown the page it fell.
     Still through the leaves its music you might hear,
     Till other springs fell faintly on the ear.


ANNURSNACK

_July 11._ At length we leave the river and take to the road which leads
to the hilltop, if by any means we may spy out what manner of earth
we inhabit. East, west, north, and south, it is farm and parish, this
world of ours. One may see how at convenient, eternal intervals men
have settled themselves, without thought for the universe. How little
matters it all they have built and delved there in the valley! It is
after all but a feature in the landscape. Still the vast impulse of
nature breathes over all. The eternal winds sweep across the interval
_to-day_, bringing mist and haze to shut out their works. Still the crow
caws from Nawshawtuct to Annursnack, as no feeble tradesman nor smith
may do. And in all swamps the hum of mosquitoes drowns this modern hum
of industry.

  [Illustration: _View from Annursnack Hill_]


EVERY MAN IS A ROMAN FORUM

All things are up and down, east and west, to _me_. In me is the forum
out of which go the Appian and Sacred ways, and a thousand beside, to
the ends of the world. If I forget my centralness, and say a bean winds
with or against the _sun_, and not right or left, it will not be true
south of the equator.


THE ASSABET

_July 18._

     Up this pleasant stream let's row
       For the livelong summer's day,
     Sprinkling foam where'er we go
     In wreaths as white as driven snow.
       Ply the oars! away! away![57]

     Now we glide along the shore,
       Chucking lilies as we go,
     While the yellow-sanded floor
     Doggedly resists the oar,
       Like some turtle dull and slow.

     Now we stem the middle tide,
       Plowing through the deepest soil;
     Ridges pile on either side,
     While we through the furrow glide,
       Reaping bubbles for our toil.

     Dew before and drought behind,
       Onward all doth seem to fly;
     Naught contents the eager mind,
     Only rapids now are kind,
       Forward are the earth and sky.


     Sudden music strikes the ear,
       Leaking out from yonder bank,
     Fit such voyagers to cheer.
     Sure there must be Naiads here,
       Who have kindly played this prank.

     There I know the cunning pack
       Where yon self-sufficient rill
     All its telltale hath kept back,
     Through the meadows held its clack,
       And now bubbleth its fill.

     Silent flows the parent stream,
       And if rocks do lie below
     Smothers with her waves the din,
     As it were a youthful sin,
       Just as still and just as slow.

     But this gleeful little rill,
       Purling round its storied pebble,
     Tinkles to the selfsame tune
     From December until June,
       Nor doth any drought enfeeble.

     See the sun behind the willows,
       Rising through the golden haze,
     How he gleams along the billows,
     Their white crests the easy pillows
       Of his dew-besprinkled rays.

     Forward press we to the dawning,
       For Aurora leads the way,
     Sultry noon and twilight scorning;
     In each dewdrop of the morning
       Lies the promise of a day.

     Rivers from the sun do flow,
       Springing with the dewy morn;
     Voyageurs 'gainst time do row,
     Idle noon nor sunset know,
       Ever even with the dawn.[58]

     Since that first "Away! away!"
       Many a lengthy league we've rowed,
     Still the sparrow on the spray
     Hastes to usher in the day
       With her simple stanza'd ode.[59]


THE BREEZE'S INVITATION

_July 20._

     Come let's roam the breezy pastures,
       Where the freest zephyrs blow,
     Batten on the oak tree's rustle,
     And the pleasant insect bustle,
       Dripping with the streamlet's flow.

     What if I no wings do wear,
       Thro' this solid-seeming air
     I can skim like any swallow;
     Whoso dareth let her follow,
       And we'll be a jovial pair.

     Like two careless swifts let's sail,
       Zephyrus shall think for me;
     Over hill and over dale,
     Riding on the easy gale,
       We will scan the earth and sea.

     Yonder see that willow tree
       Winnowing the buxom air;
     You a gnat and I a bee,
     With our merry minstrelsy
       We will make a concert there.

     One green leaf shall be our screen,
       Till the sun doth go to bed,
     I the king and you the queen
     Of that peaceful little green,
       Without any subject's aid.

     To our music Time will linger,
       And earth open wide her ear,
     Nor shall any need to tarry
     To immortal verse to marry
       Such sweet music as he'll hear.


_July 24._

     Nature doth have her dawn each day,
     But mine are far between;
     Content, I cry, for, sooth to say,
     Mine brightest are, I ween.

     For when my sun doth deign to rise,
     Though it be her noontide,
     Her fairest field in shadow lies,
     Nor can my light abide.


     Sometimes I bask me in her day,
     Conversing with my mate;
     But if we interchange one ray,
     Forthwith her heats abate.

     Through his discourse I climb and see,
     As from some eastern hill,
     A brighter morrow rise to me
     Than lieth in her skill.

     As't were two summer days in one,
     Two Sundays come together,
     Our rays united make one sun,
     With fairest summer weather.[60]


_July 25._ There is no remedy for love but to love more.


_Aug. 31._ Made seven miles, and moored our boat on the west side of a
little rising ground which in the spring forms an island in the river,
the sun going down on one hand, and our eminence contributing its shadow
to the night on the other.[61] In the twilight so elastic is the air
that the sky seems to tinkle [_sic_] over farmhouse and wood. Scrambling
up the bank of our _terra incognita_ we fall on huckleberries, which
have slowly ripened here, husbanding the juices which the months have
distilled, for our peculiar use this night.[62] If they had been rank
poison, the entire simplicity and confidence with which we plucked them
would have insured their wholesomeness. The devout attitude of the hour
asked a blessing on that repast. It was fit for the setting sun to rest
on.

       *       *       *       *       *

From our tent here on the hillside, through that isosceles door, I see
our lonely mast on the shore, it may be as an eternity fixture, to be
seen in landscapes henceforth, or as the most temporary standstill of
time, the boat just come to anchor, and the mast still rocking to find
its balance.[63]

       *       *       *       *       *

No human life is in night,—the woods, the boat, the shore,—yet is it
lifelike.[64] The warm pulse of a young life beats steadily underneath
all. This slight wind is where one artery approaches the surface and is
skin deep.

       *       *       *       *       *

While I write here, I hear the foxes trotting about me over the dead
leaves, and now gently over the grass, as if not to disturb the dew
which is falling. Why should we not cultivate neighborly relations with
the foxes? As if to improve upon our seeming advances, comes one to
greet us nosewise under our tent-curtain. Nor do we rudely repulse him.
Is man powder and the fox flint and steel? Has not the time come when
men and foxes shall lie down together?

       *       *       *       *       *

Hist! there, the musquash by the boat is taking toll of potatoes and
melons. Is not this the age of a community of goods? His presumption
kindles in me a brotherly feeling. Nevertheless. I get up to
reconnoitre, and tread stealthily along the shore to make acquaintance
with him. But on the riverside I can see only the stars reflected in the
water, and now, by some ripple ruffling the disk of a star, I discover
him.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the silence of the night the sound of a distant alarm bell is borne
to these woods. Even now men have fires and extinguish them, and, with
distant horizon blazings and barking of dogs, enact the manifold drama
of life.[65]

       *       *       *       *       *

We begin to have an interest in sun, moon, and stars. What time
riseth Orion? Which side the pole gropeth the bear? East, West,
North, and South,—where are they? What clock shall tell the hours for
us?—Billerica, midnight.


_Sept. 1. Sunday._ Under an oak on the bank of the canal in Chelmsford.

From Ball's Hill to Billerica meeting-house the river is a noble stream
of water, flowing between gentle hills and occasional cliffs, and well
wooded all the way. It can hardly be said to flow at all, but rests
in the lap of the hills like a quiet lake. The boatmen call it a dead
stream. For many long reaches you can see nothing to indicate that men
inhabit its banks.[66] Nature seems to hold a sabbath herself to-day,—a
still warm sun on river and wood, and not breeze enough to ruffle the
water. Cattle stand up to their bellies in the river, and you think
Rembrandt should be here.

Camped under some oaks in Tyngsboro, on the east bank of the Merrimack,
just below the ferry.[67]


_Sept. 2._ Camped in Merrimack, on the west bank, by a deep ravine.[68]


_Sept. 3._ In Bedford, on the west bank, opposite a large rock, above
Coos Falls.[69]


_Sept. 4. Wednesday._ Hooksett, east bank, two or three miles below the
village, opposite Mr. Mitchel's.[70]


_Sept. 5._ Walked to Concord [N. H.], 10 miles.[71]


_Sept. 6._ By stage to Plymouth, 40 miles, and on foot to Tilton's inn,
Thornton. The scenery commences on Sanbornton Square, whence the White
Mountains are first visible. In Campton it is decidedly mountainous.


_Sept. 7._ Walked from Thornton through Peeling[72] and Lincoln to
Franconia. In Lincoln visited Stone Flume and Basin, and in Franconia
the Notch, and saw the Old Man of the Mountain.


_Sept. 8._ Walked from Franconia to Thomas J. Crawford's.


_Sept. 9._ At Crawford's.


_Sept. 10._ Ascended the mountain and rode to Conway.


_Sept. 11._ Rode to Concord.


_Sept. 12._ Rode to Hooksett and rowed to Bedford, N. H., or rather to
the northern part of Merrimack, near the ferry, by a large island, near
which we camped.[73]


_Sept 13._ Rowed and sailed to Concord, about 50 miles.[74]


THE WISE REST

_Sept 17._ Nature never makes haste; her systems revolve at an even
pace. The bud swells imperceptibly, without hurry or confusion, as
though the short spring days were an eternity.[75] All her operations
seem separately, for the time, the single object for which all things
tarry. Why, then, should man hasten as if anything less than eternity
were allotted for the least deed? Let him consume never so many æons,
so that he go about the meanest task well, though it be but the paring
of his nails.[76] If the setting sun seems to hurry him to improve the
day while it lasts, the chant of the crickets fails not to reassure him,
even-measured as of old, teaching him to take his own time henceforth
forever. The wise man is restful, never restless or impatient. He each
moment abides there where he is, as some walkers actually rest the whole
body at each step, while others never relax the muscles of the leg till
the accumulated fatigue obliges them to stop short.

As the wise is not anxious that time wait for him, neither does he wait
for it.


_Oct 22._ Nature will bear the closest inspection. She invites us to
lay our eye level with her smallest leaf, and take an insect view of
its plain.[77]


ÆSCHYLUS

_Nov. 5._ There was one man lived his own healthy Attic life in those
days. The words that have come down to us evidence that their speaker
was a seer in his day and generation. At this day they owe nothing to
their dramatic form, nothing to stage machinery, and the fact that they
were spoken under these or those circumstances. All display of art for
the gratification of a factitious taste is silently passed by to come
at the least particle of absolute and genuine thought they contain. The
reader will be disappointed, however, who looks for traits of a rare
wisdom or eloquence, and will have to solace himself, for the most part,
with the poet's humanity and what it was in him to say. He will discover
that, like every genius, he was a solitary liver and worker in his day.

We are accustomed to say that the common sense of this age belonged to
the seer of the last,—as if time gave him any vantage ground. But not
so: I see not but Genius must ever take an equal start, and all the
generations of men are virtually at a standstill for it to come and
consider of them. Common sense is not so familiar with any truth but
Genius will represent it in a strange light to it. Let the seer bring
down his broad eye to the most stale and trivial fact, and he will make
you believe it a new planet in the sky.

As to criticism, man has never to make allowance to man; there is naught
to excuse, naught to bear in mind.

All the past is here present to be tried; let it approve itself if it
can.


GROWTH

We are not apt to remember that we grow. It is curious to reflect how
the maiden waiteth patiently, confiding as the unripe houstonia of the
meadow, for the slow moving years to work their will with her,—perfect
and ripen her,—like it to be fanned by the wind, watered by the rain,
and receive her education at the hands of nature.

These young buds of manhood in the streets are like buttercups in the
meadows,—surrendered to nature as they.


_Nov. 7._ I was not aware till to-day of a rising and risen generation.
Children appear to me as raw as the fresh fungi on a fence rail. By
what degrees of consanguinity is this succulent and rank-growing slip
of manhood related to me? What is it but another herb, ranging all the
kingdoms of nature, drawing in sustenance by a thousand roots and fibres
from all soils.


LACONICISM

_Nov. 8._ Prometheus' answer to Io's question, who has bound him to the
rock, is a good instance:—

     Βούλουμα μὲν τὸ δῖον, Ἡφαίστου δὲ χείρ.

     (The will indeed of Zeus, of Vulcan the hand.)

Also:—

     Πταίσας δὲ τῷδε πρὸς κακῷ, μαθήσεται,
     Ὅσον τό, τ᾽ ἄρχειν καὶ τὸ δουλούειν δίχα.

Such naked speech is the standing aside of words to make room for
thoughts.


REGRET

_Nov. 13._ Make the most of your regrets; never smother your sorrow,
but tend and cherish it till it come to have a separate and integral
interest. To regret deeply is to live afresh. By so doing you will be
astonished to find yourself restored once more to all your emoluments.


DESPONDENCY

_Nov. 14._ There is nowhere any apology for despondency. Always there is
life which, rightly lived, implies a divine satisfaction. I am soothed
by the rain-drops on the door-sill; every globule that pitches thus
confidently from the eaves to the ground is my life insurance. Disease
and a rain-drop cannot coexist. The east wind is not itself consumptive,
but has enjoyed a rare health from of old. If a fork or brand stand
erect, good is portended by it. They are the warrant of universal
innocence.


FAREWELL

_Nov. 19._

     Light-hearted, thoughtless, shall I take my way,
     When I to thee this being have resigned,
     Well knowing where, upon a future day,
     With us'rer's craft more than myself to find.


LINNÆUS

_Nov. 22._ Linnæus, setting out for Lapland, surveys his "comb" and
"spare shirt," "leather breeches," and "gauze cap to keep off gnats,"
with as much complacency as Buonaparte would a park of artillery to be
used in the Russian Campaign. His eye is to take in fish, flower, and
bird, quadruped and biped. The quiet bravery of the man is admirable.
These facts have even a _novel_ interest.[78]


_Nov. 29._ Many brave men have there been, thank Fortune, but I shall
never grow brave by comparison. When I remember myself I shall forget
them.


BRAVERY

_Dec. 2._ A rare landscape immediately suggests a suitable inhabitant,
whose breath shall be its wind, whose moods its seasons, and to whom
it will always be fair. To be chafed and worried, and not as serene as
Nature, does not become one whose nature is as steadfast as she. We do
all stand in the front ranks of the battle every moment of our lives;
where there is a brave man there is the thickest of the fight, there
the post of honor. Not he who procures a substitute to go to Florida is
exempt from service; he gathers his laurels in another field. Waterloo
is not the only battle-ground: as many and fatal guns are pointed at my
breast now as are contained in the English arsenals.


NOON

[_Undated._][79]

                               Straightway dissolved,
     Like to the morning mists—or rather like the subtler mists of noon—
     Stretched I far up the neighboring mountain's sides,
     Adown the valleys, through the nether air,
     Bathing, with fond expansiveness of soul,
     The tiniest blade as the sublimest cloud.

     What time the bittern, solitary bird,
     Hides now her head amid the whispering fern,
     And not a paddock vexes all the shore,
     Nor feather ruffles the incumbent air,
     Save where the wagtail interrupts the noon.


FROM A CHAPTER ON BRAVERY.—_Script_

_Dec._ Bravery deals not so much in resolute action, as in healthy
and assured rest. Its palmy state is a staying at home, and compelling
alliance in all directions.[80]

The brave man never heareth the din of war; he is trustful and
unsuspecting, so observant of the least trait of good or beautiful that,
if you turn toward him the dark side of anything, he will still see only
the bright.

       *       *       *       *       *

One moment of serene and confident life is more glorious than a whole
campaign of daring. We should be ready for all issues, not daring to
die but daring to live. To the brave even danger is an ally.

       *       *       *       *       *

In their unconscious daily life all are braver than they know. Man
slumbers and wakes in his twilight with the confidence of noonday; he is
not palsied nor struck dumb by the inexplicable riddle of the universe.
A mere surveyor's report or clause in a preëmption bill contains matter
of quite extraneous interest, of a subdued but confident tone, evincing
such a steadiness in the writer as would have done wonders at Bunker's
Hill or Marathon. Where there is the collected eye, there will not fail
the effective hand; χεὶρ δ᾽ ὁρᾷ τὸ δράσιμον.

       *       *       *       *       *

Science is always brave, for to know is to know good; doubt and danger
quail before her eye. What the coward overlooks in his hurry, she calmly
scrutinizes, breaking ground like a pioneer for the array of arts in
her train. Cowardice is unscientific, for there cannot be a science
of ignorance. There may be a science of war, for that advances, but
a retreat is rarely well conducted; if it is, then is it an orderly
advance in the face of circumstances.[81]

       *       *       *       *       *

If his fortune deserts him, the brave man in pity still abides by her.
Samuel Johnson and his friend Savage, compelled by poverty to pass the
night in the streets, resolve that they will stand by their country.

       *       *       *       *       *

The state of complete manhood is virtue, and virtue and bravery are
one. This truth has long been in the languages. All the relations of
the subject are hinted at in the derivation and analogies of the Latin
words _vir_ and _virtus_, and the Greek ἀγαθός and ἄριστος. Language
in its settled form is the record of men's second thoughts, a more
faithful utterance than they can momentarily give. What men say is so
sifted and obliged to approve itself as answering to a common want,
that nothing absolutely frivolous obtains currency in the language. The
analogies of words are never whimsical and meaningless, but stand for
real likenesses. Only the ethics of mankind, and not of any particular
man, give point and vigor to our speech.

       *       *       *       *       *

The coward was born one day too late, for he has never overtaken the
present hour. He is the younger son of creation, who now waiteth till
the elder decease.[82] He does not dwell on the earth as though he had
a deed of the land in his pocket,—not as another lump of nature, as
imperturbable an occupant as the stones in the field. He has only rented
a few acres of time and space, and thinks that every accident portends
the expiration of his lease. He is a non-proprietor, a serf, in his
moral economy nomadic, having no fixed abode. When danger appears, he
goes abroad and clings to straws.

       *       *       *       *       *

Bravery and Cowardice are kindred correlatives with Knowledge and
Ignorance, Light and Darkness, Good and Evil.

       *       *       *       *       *

If you let a single ray of light through the shutter, it will go on
diffusing itself without limit till it enlighten the world, but the
shadow that was never so wide at first as rapidly contracts till it
comes to naught. The shadow of the moon when it passes nearest the sun
is lost in space ere it can reach our earth to eclipse it. Always the
_system_ shines with uninterrupted light, for, as the sun is so much
larger than any planet, no shadow can travel far into space. We may
bask always in the light of the system, always may step back out of
the shade. No man's shadow is as large as his body, if the rays make a
right angle with the reflecting surface. Let our lives be passed under
the equator, with the sun in the meridian.

There is no ill which may not be dissipated like the dark, if you let
in a stronger light upon it. Overcome evil with good. Practice no such
narrow economy as they whose bravery amounts to no more light than a
farthing candle, before which most objects cast a shadow wider than
themselves.[83]

       *       *       *       *       *

It was a conceit of Plutarch, accounting for the preferences given
to signs observed on the left hand, that men may have thought "things
terrestrial and mortal directly over against heavenly and divine things,
and do conjecture that the things which to us are on the left hand,
the gods send down from their right hand."[84] If we are not blind, we
shall see how a right hand is stretched over all, as well the unlucky
as lucky, and that the ordering soul is only right-handed, distributing
with one palm all our fates.[85]

       *       *       *       *       *

Men have made war from a deeper instinct than peace. War is but the
compelling of peace.[86]

When the world is declared under martial law, every Esau retakes his
birthright, and what there is in him does not fail to appear. He wipes
off all old scores and commences a new account. The world is interested
to know how any soul will demean itself in so novel a position. But when
war too, like commerce and husbandry, gets to be a routine, and men go
about it as indented apprentices, the hero degenerates into a marine,
and the standing army into a standing jest.

       *       *       *       *       *

No pains are spared to do honor to the brave soldier. All guilds and
corporations are taxed to provide him with fit harness and equipment.
His coat must be red as the sunset, or blue as the heavens. Gold
or silver, pinchbeck or copper, solid or superficial, mark him for
fortune's favorite. The skill of a city enchases and tempers his
sword-blade; the Tyrian dye confounds him with emperors and kings.
Wherever he goes, music precedes and prepares the way for him. His life
is a holiday, and the contagion of his example unhinges the universe.
The world puts by work and comes out to stare. He is the one only man.
He recognizes no time-honored casts and conventions, no fixtures but
transfixtures, no governments at length settled on a permanent basis.
One tap of the drum sets the political and moral harmonies all ajar.
His ethics may well bear comparison with the priest's. He may rally,
charge, retreat in an orderly manner, but never flee nor flinch.[87]

     Each more melodious note I hear
     Brings sad reproach to me,
     That I alone afford the ear,
     Who would the music be.[88]

The brave man is the sole patron of music;[89] he recognizes it for his
mother-tongue,—a more mellifluous and articulate language than words,
in comparison with which speech is recent and temporary. It is his
voice. His language must have the same majestic movement and cadence
that philosophy assigns to the heavenly bodies. The steady flux of his
thought constitutes time in music. The universe falls in and keeps pace
with it, which before proceeded singly and discordant. Hence are poetry
and song. When Bravery first grew afraid and went to war, it took music
along with it. The soul delighted still to hear the echo of its own
voice. Especially the soldier insists on agreement and harmony always.
Indeed, it is that friendship there is in war that makes it chivalrous
and heroic. It was the dim sentiment of a noble friendship for the
purest soul the world has seen, that gave to Europe a crusading era.[90]

       *       *       *       *       *

The day of tilts and tournaments has gone by, but no herald summons us
to the tournament of love.

       *       *       *       *       *

The brave warrior must have harmony if not melody at any sacrifice.
Consider what shifts he makes. There are the bagpipe, the gong, the
trumpet, the drum,—either the primitive central African or Indian, or
the brass European. Ever since Jericho fell down before a blast of rams'
horns, the martial and musical have gone hand in hand. If the soldier
marches to the sack of a town, he must be preceded by drum and trumpet,
which shall as it were identify his cause with the accordant universe.
All woods and walls echo back his own spirit, and the hostile territory
is then preoccupied for him. He is no longer insulated, but infinitely
related and familiar. The roll-call musters for him all the forces of
nature.[91]

       *       *       *       *       *

All sounds, and more than all, silence, do fife and drum for us.[92] The
least creaking doth whet all our senses and emit a tremulous light, like
the aurora borealis, over things. As polishing expresses the vein in
marble and the grain in wood, so music brings out what of heroic lurks
anywhere.[93]

       *       *       *       *       *

To the sensitive soul, the universe has its own fixed measure, which is
its measure also, and, as a regular pulse is inseparable from a healthy
body, so is its healthiness dependent on the regularity of its rhythm.
In all sounds the soul recognizes its own rhythm, and seeks to express
its sympathy by a correspondent movement of the limbs. When the body
marches to the measure of the soul, then is true courage and invincible
strength.[94]

       *       *       *       *       *

The coward would reduce this thrilling sphere music to a universal
wail, this melodious chant to a nasal cant. He thinks to conciliate all
hostile influences by compelling his neighborhood into a partial concord
with himself, but his music is no better than a jingle which is akin to
a jar,—jars regularly recurring.[95]

He blows a feeble blast of slender melody, because nature can have no
more sympathy with such a soul than it has of cheerful melody in itself.
Hence hears he no accordant note in the universe, and is a coward, or
consciously outcast and deserted man. But the brave man, without drum or
trumpet, compels concord everywhere by the universality and tunefulness
of his soul.[96]

"Take a metallic plate," says Coleridge, "and strew sand on it; sound
a harmonic chord over the sand, and the grains will whirl about in
circles, and other geometrical figures, all, as it were, depending on
some point relatively at rest. Sound a discord, and every grain will
whisk about without any order at all, in no figures, and with no points
of rest." The brave man is such a point of relative rest, over which
the soul sounds ever a harmonic chord.

       *       *       *       *       *

Music is either a sedative or a tonic to the soul.[97] I read that
"Plato thinks the gods never gave men music, the science of melody
and harmony, for mere delectation or to tickle the ear; but that the
discordant parts of the circulations and beauteous fabric of the soul,
and that of it that roves about the body, and many times, for want of
tune and air, breaks forth into many extravagances and excesses, might
be sweetly recalled and artfully wound up to their former consent and
agreement."[98]

       *       *       *       *       *

By dint of wind and stringed instruments the coward endeavors to put
the best face on the matter,—whistles to keep his courage up.

       *       *       *       *       *

There are some brave traits related by Plutarch; e. g.: "Homer acquaints
us how Ajax, being to engage in a single combat with Hector, bade
the Grecians pray to the gods for him; and while they were at their
devotions, he was putting on his armor."

On another occasion, a storm arises, "which as soon as the pilot sees,
he falls to his prayers, and invokes his tutelar dæmons, but neglects
not in the meantime to hold to the rudder and let down the main yard."

"Homer directs his husbandman, before he either plow or sow, to pray
to the terrestrial Jove and the venerable Ceres, but with his hand upon
the plow-tail."

Ἀρχὴ γὰρ ὄντως τοῦ νικᾷν τὸ θαῤῥεῖν. (Verily, to be brave is the
beginning of victory.)

       *       *       *       *       *

The Romans "made Fortune surname to Fortitude," for fortitude is that
alchemy that turns all things to good fortune. The man of fortitude,
whom the Latins called fortis, is no other than that lucky person
whom _fors_ favors, or _vir summae fortis_. If we will, every bark may
"carry Cæsar and Cæsar's fortune." The brave man stays at home. For an
impenetrable shield, stand inside yourself; he was an arrant coward who
first made shields of brass. For armor of proof, mea virtute me involvo
(I wrap myself in my virtue);

     "Tumble me down, and I will sit
     Upon my ruins, smiling yet."[99]

       *       *       *       *       *

The bravest deed, which for the most part is left quite out of history,
which alone wants the staleness of a deed done and the uncertainty
of a deed doing, is the life of a great man. To perform exploits is
to be temporarily bold, as becomes a courage that ebbs and flows, the
soul quite vanquished by its own deed subsiding into indifference and
cowardice; but the exploit of a brave life consists in its momentary
completeness.[100]


FRIENDSHIP [101]

_Fall of_ 1839. Then first I conceive of a true friendship, when some
rare specimen of manhood presents itself. It seems the mission of such
to commend virtue to mankind, not by any imperfect preaching of her
word, but by their own carriage and conduct. We may then worship moral
beauty without the formality of a religion.

They are some fresher wind that blows, some new fragrance that breathes.
They make the landscape and the sky for us.

       *       *       *       *       *

The rules of other intercourse are all inapplicable to this.

       *       *       *       *       *

We are one virtue, one truth, one beauty. All nature is our satellite,
whose light is dull and reflected. She is subaltern to us,—an episode to
our poem; but we are primary, and radiate light and heat to the system.

       *       *       *       *       *

I am only introduced once again to myself.

       *       *       *       *       *

Conversation, contact, familiarity are the steps to it and instruments
of it, but it is most perfect when these are done, and distance and time
oppose no barrier.

       *       *       *       *       *

I need not ask any man to be my friend, more than the sun the earth
to be attracted by him. It is not his to give, nor mine to receive. I
cannot pardon my enemy; let him pardon himself.

       *       *       *       *       *

Commonly we degrade Love and Friendship by presenting them under the
aspect of a trivial dualism.

       *       *       *       *       *

What matter a few words more or less with my friend,—with all
mankind;—they will still be my friends in spite of themselves. Let them
stand aloof if they can! As though the most formidable distance could
rob me of any real sympathy or advantage! No, when such interests are
at stake, time, and distance, and difference fall into their own places.

       *       *       *       *       *

But alas! to be actually separated from that parcel of heaven we call
our friend, with the suspicion that we shall no more meet in nature, is
source enough for all the elegies that ever were written. But the true
remedy will be to recover our friend again piecemeal, wherever we can
find a feature, as Æetes gathered up the members of his son, which Medea
had strewn in her path.

       *       *       *       *       *

The more complete our sympathy, the more our senses are struck dumb,
and we are repressed by a delicate respect, so that to indifferent eyes
we are least his friend, because no vulgar symbols pass between us. On
after thought, perhaps, we come to fear that we have been the losers by
such seeming indifference, but in truth that which withholds us is the
bond between us.

       *       *       *       *       *

My friend will be as much better than myself as my aspiration is above
my performance.

       *       *       *       *       *

This is most serene autumn weather. The chirp of crickets may be
heard at noon over all the land. As in summer they are heard only at
nightfall, so now by their incessant chirp they usher in the evening of
the year.[102] The lively decay of autumn promises as infinite duration
and freshness as the green leaves of spring.
