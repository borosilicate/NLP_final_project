Chapter XIII MAY, 1851.


_May 1._ Observed the _Nuphar advena_, yellow water-lily, in blossom;
also the _Laurus Benzoin_, or fever-bush, spice-wood, near William
Wheeler’s in Lincoln, resembling the witch-hazel. It is remarkable that
this aromatic shrub, though it grows by the roadside and does not hide
itself, may be, as it were, effectually concealed, though it blossoms
every spring. It may be observed only once in many years.

The blossom-buds of the peach have expanded just enough to give a
slight peach tint to the orchards.

In regard to purity, I do not know whether I am much worse or better
than my acquaintances. If I confine my thought to myself, I appear,
whether by constitution or by education, irrevocably impure, as if
I should be shunned by my fellow-men if they knew me better, as if I
were of two inconsistent natures; but again, when I observe how the
mass of men speak of woman and of chastity,—with how little love and
reverence,—I feel that so far I am unaccountably better than they. I
think that none of my acquaintances has a greater love and admiration
for chastity than I have. Perhaps it is necessary that one should
actually stand low himself in order to reverence what is high in
others.

All distant landscapes seen from hilltops are veritable pictures,
which will be found to have no actual existence to him who travels
to them. “’T is distance lends enchantment to the view.” It is the
bare landscape without this depth of atmosphere to glass it. The
distant river-reach seen in the north from the Lincoln Hill, high in
the horizon, like the ocean stream flowing round Homer’s shield, the
rippling waves reflecting the light, is unlike the same seen near at
hand. Heaven intervenes between me and the object. By what license do
I call it Concord River. It redeems the character of rivers to see them
thus. They were worthy then of a place on Homer’s shield.

As I looked to-day from Mt. Tabor in Lincoln to the Waltham hill, I
saw the same deceptive slope, the near hill melting into the further
inseparably, indistinguishably; it was one gradual slope from the
base of the near hill to the summit of the further one, a succession
of copse-woods, but I knew that there intervened a valley two or
three miles wide, studded with houses and orchards and drained by a
considerable stream. When the shadow of a cloud passed over the nearer
hill, I could distinguish its shaded summit against the side of the
other.

I had in my mind’s eye a silent gray tarn which I had seen the summer
before high up on the side of a mountain, Bald Mountain, where the
half-dead spruce trees stood far in the water draped with wreathy mist
as with usnea moss, made of dews, where the mountain spirit bathed;
whose bottom was high above the surface of other lakes. Spruces whose
dead limbs were more in harmony with the mists which draped them.

The forenoon that I moved to my house, a poor old lame fellow who had
formerly frozen his feet hobbled off the road, came and stood before my
door with one hand on each door-post, looking into the house, and asked
for a drink of water. I knew that rum or something like it was the only
drink he loved, but I gave him a dish of warm pond water, which was all
I had, nevertheless, which to my astonishment he drank, being used to
drinking.

Nations! What are nations? Tartars! and Huns! and Chinamen! Like
insects they swarm. The historian strives in vain to make them
memorable. It is for want of a man that there are so many men. It is
individuals that populate the world.


THE SPIRIT OF LODIN

     “I look down from my height on nations,
     And they become ashes before me;
     Calm is my dwelling in the clouds;
     Pleasant are the great fields of my rest.”[164]

Man is as singular as God.

There is a certain class of unbelievers who sometimes ask me such
questions as, if I think that I can live on vegetable food alone; and
to strike at the root of the matter at once, I am accustomed to answer
such, “Yes, I can live on board nails.” If they cannot understand that,
they cannot understand much that I have to say. That cuts the matter
short with them. For my own part, I am glad to hear of experiments of
this kind being tried; as that a young man tried for a fortnight to see
if he could live on hard, raw corn on the ear, using his tooth for his
only mortar. The squirrel tribe tried the same and succeeded. The human
race is interested in these experiments, though a few old women may be
alarmed, who own their thirds in mills.[165]

Khaled would have his weary soldiers vigilant still; apprehending a
midnight sally from the enemy, “Let no man sleep,” said he. “We shall
have rest enough after death.” Would such an exhortation be understood
by Yankee soldiers?

Omar answered the dying Abu Beker: “O successor to the apostle of God!
spare me from this burden. I have no need of the Caliphat.” “But the
Caliphat has need of you!” replied the dying Abu Beker.

“Heraclius had heard of the mean attire of the Caliph Omar, and asked
why, having gained so much wealth by his conquests, he did not go
richly clad like other princes? They replied, that he cared not for
this world, but for the world to come, and sought favor in the eyes
of God alone. ‘In what kind of a palace does he reside?’ asked the
emperor. ‘In a house built of mud.’ ‘Who are his attendants?’ ‘Beggars
and the poor.’ ‘What tapestry does he sit upon?’ ‘Justice and equity.’
‘What is his throne?’ ‘Abstinence and true knowledge.’ ‘What is his
treasure?’ ‘Trust in God.’ ‘And who are his guard?’ ‘The bravest of the
Unitarians.’”

It was the custom of Ziyad, once governor of Bassora, “wherever he held
sway, to order the inhabitants to leave their doors open at night, with
merely a hurdle at the entrance to exclude cattle, engaging to replace
any thing that should be stolen: and so effective was his police, that
no robberies were committed.”

Abdallah was “so fixed and immovable in prayer, that a pigeon once
perched upon his head mistaking him for a statue.”


_May 6. Monday._ The Harivansa describes a “substance called
_Poroucha_, a spiritual substance known also under the name of Mahat,
spirit united to the five elements, soul of being, now enclosing
itself in a body like ours, now returning to the eternal body; it is
mysterious wisdom, the perpetual sacrifice made by the virtue of the
_Yoga_, the fire which animates animals, shines in the sun, and is
mingled with all bodies. Its nature is to be born and to die, to pass
from repose to movement. The spirit led astray by the senses, in the
midst of the creation of Brahma, engages itself in works and knows
birth, as well as death. The organs of the senses are its paths, and
its work manifests itself in this creation of Brahma. Thought tormented
by desires, is like the sea agitated by the wind. Brahma has said: the
heart filled with strange affections is to be here below purified by
wisdom. Here below even, clothed already as it were in a luminous form,
let the spirit, though clogged by the bonds of the body, prepare for
itself an abode sure and permanent.

“He who would obtain final emancipation must abstain from every
exterior action. The operation which conducts the pious and penitent
Brahman to the knowledge of the truth, is all interior, intellectual,
mental. They are not ordinary practices which can bring light into the
soul.

“The Mouni who desires his final emancipation will have care evening
and morning to subdue his senses, to fix his mind on the divine
essence, and to transport himself by the force of his soul to the
eternal abode of Vichnou. Although he may have engaged in works, he
does not wear the clog of them, because his soul is not attached to
them. A being returns to life in consequence of the affection which he
has borne for terrestrial things: he finds himself emancipated, when he
has felt only indifference for them.

“The Richis mingle with nature, which remains strange to their senses.
Luminous and brilliant they cover themselves with a humid vapor, under
which they seem no more to exist, although existing always, like the
thread which is lost and confounded in the woof.

“Free in this world, as the birds in the air, disengaged from every
kind of chain.

“Thus the Yogin, absorbed in contemplation, contributes for his part
to creation: he breathes a divine perfume, he hears wonderful things.
Divine forms traverse him without tearing him, and united to the
nature which is proper to him, he goes, he acts, as animating original
matter.”

Like some other preachers, I have added my texts—derived from the
Chinese and Hindoo scriptures—long after my discourse was written.

A commentary on the Sankhya Karika says, “By external knowledge worldly
distinction is acquired; by internal knowledge, liberation.”

       *       *       *       *       *

The Sankhya Karika says, “By attainment of perfect knowledge, virtue
and the rest become causeless; yet soul remains awhile invested with
body, as the potter’s wheel continues whirling from the effect of the
impulse previously given to it.”

I rejoice that horses and steers have to [be] _broken_ before they can
be made the slaves of men, and that men themselves have some wild oats
still left to sow before they become submissive members of society.
Undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization,
and because the majority, like dogs and sheep, are tame by inherited
disposition, is no reason why the others should have their natures
broken, that they may be reduced to the same level. Men are in the
main alike, but they were made several in order that [they] might
be various. If a low use is to be served, one man will do nearly or
quite as well as another; if a high one, individual excellence is to
be regarded. Any man can stop a hole to keep the wind away, but no
other man can serve that use which the author of this illustration did.
Confucius says, “The skins of the tiger and the leopard when they are
tanned, are as the skins of the dog and the sheep tanned.” But it is
not the part of a true culture to tame tigers, any more than it is to
make sheep ferocious. It is evident, then, that tanning their skins for
shoes and the like is not the best use to which they can be put.[166]

How important is a constant intercourse with nature and the
contemplation of natural phenomena to the preservation of moral and
intellectual health! The discipline of the schools or of business can
never impart such serenity to the mind. The philosopher contemplates
human affairs as calmly and from as great a remoteness as he does
natural phenomena. The ethical philosopher needs the discipline of
the natural philosopher. He approaches the study of mankind with great
advantages who is accustomed to the study of nature.

The Brahman Saradwata, says the Dharma Sacontala, was at first
confounded on entering the city, “but now,” says he, “I look on it as
the freeman on the captive, as a man just bathed in pure water on a man
smeared with oil and dust.”


_May 10._ Heard the snipe over the meadows this evening.


_May 12._ Heard the golden robin and the bobolink.

But where she has her seat,—whether in Westford or in Boxboro,—not
even the assessors know. Inquire perchance of that dusky family on
the cross-road, which is said to have Indian blood in their veins.
Or perchance where this old cellar-hole now grassed over is faintly
visible, Nature once had her dwelling. Ask the crazy old woman who
brings huckleberries to the village, but who lives nobody knows where.

If I have got false teeth, I trust that I have not got a false
conscience. It is safer to employ the dentist than the priest to repair
the deficiencies of nature.

By taking the ether the other day I was convinced how far asunder a man
could be separated from his senses. You are told that it will make you
unconscious, but no one can imagine what it is to be unconscious—how
far removed from the state of consciousness and all that we call “this
world”—until he has experienced it. The value of the experiment is
that it does give you experience of an interval as between one life and
another,—a greater space than you ever travelled. You are a sane mind
without organs,—groping for organs,—which if it did not soon recover
its old senses would get new ones. You expand like a seed in the
ground. You exist in your roots, like a tree in the winter. If you have
an inclination to travel, take the ether; you go beyond the furthest
star.

It is not necessary for them to take ether, who in their sane and
waking hours are ever translated by a thought; nor for them to see with
their hindheads, who sometimes see from their foreheads; nor listen to
the spiritual knockings, who attend to the intimations of reason and
conscience.


_May 16._ Heard the whip-poor-will this evening. A splendid full moon
to-night. Walked from 6.30 to 10 P. M. Lay on a rock near a meadow,
which had absorbed and retained much heat, so that I could warm my back
on it, it being a cold night. I found that the side of the sand-hill
was cold on the surface, but warm two or three inches beneath.[167]

If there is a more splendid moonlight than usual, only the belated
traveller observes it. When I am outside, on the outskirts of the town,
enjoying the still majesty of the moon, I am wont to think that all men
are aware of this miracle, that they too are silently worshipping this
manifestation of divinity elsewhere. But when I go into the house I
am undeceived; they are absorbed in checkers or chess or novel, though
they may have been advertised of the brightness through the shutters.

In the moonlight night what intervals are created! The rising moon is
related to the near pine tree which rises above the forest, and we get
a juster notion of distance. The moon is only somewhat further off and
on one side. There may be only three objects,—myself, a pine tree, and
the moon, nearly equidistant.

Talk of demonstrating the rotation of the earth on its axis,—see the
moon rise, or the sun!

The moonlight reveals the beauty of trees. By day it is so light and in
this climate so _cold_ commonly, that we do not perceive their shade.
We do not know when we are beneath them.

According to Michaux, the canoe birch (_Betula papyracea_) ceases
below the forty-third degree of latitude. Sections of the wood from
just below the first ramification are used to inlay mahogany, in these
parts. It is brought from Maine for fuel.

Common white birch (_B. populifolia_) not found south of Virginia.
Its epidermis incapable of being divided like the canoe birch and the
European white.

The common alder (_Alnus serrulata_) blooms in January.

The locust (_Robinia Pseudacacia_) was one of the earliest trees
introduced into Europe from America (by one Robin, about 1601); now
extensively propagated in England, France, and Germany. Used for
trunnels to the exclusion of all others in the Middle and Southern
States. Instead of decaying, acquire hardness with time.


_May 18. Sunday._ Lady’s-slipper almost fully blossomed. The log of
a canoe birch on Fair Haven, cut down the last winter, more than a
foot in diameter at the stump; one foot in diameter at ten feet from
the ground. I observed that all parts of the epidermis exposed to the
air and light were white, but the inner surfaces, freshly exposed,
were a buff or salmon-color. Sinclair says that in winter it is white
throughout. But this was cut before the sap flowed??! Was there any
sap in the log? I counted about fifty rings. The shrub oaks are now
blossoming. The scarlet tanagers are come. The oak leaves of all colors
are just expanding, and are more beautiful than most flowers. The
hickory buds are almost leaves. The landscape has a new life and light
infused into it. The deciduous trees are springing, to countenance
the pines, which are evergreen. It seems to take but one summer day
to fetch the summer in. The turning-point between winter and summer
is reached. The birds are in full blast. There is a peculiar freshness
about the landscape; you scent the fragrance of new leaves, of hickory
and sassafras, etc. And to the eye the forest presents the tenderest
green. The blooming of the apple trees is becoming general.

I think that I have made out two kinds of poplar,—the _Populus
tremuloides_, or American aspen, and the _P. grandidentata_, or large
American aspen, whose young leaves are downy.

       *       *       *       *       *

Michaux says that the locust begins to convert its sap into perfect
wood from the third year; which is not done by the oak, the chestnut,
the beech, and the elm till after the tenth or the fifteenth year.

He quotes the saying, “The foot of the owner is the best manure for
his land.” “He” is Augustus L. Hillhouse, who writes the account of the
olive at the request of Michaux.

The elder Michaux found the balsam poplar (_P. balsamifera_) very
abundant on Lake St. John and the Saguenay River, where it is eighty
feet high and three feet in diameter. This, however, is distinct
from the _P. candicans_, heart-leaved balsam poplar, which M. finds
hereabouts, though never in the woods, and does not know where it came
from.

He praises the Lombardy poplar because, its limbs being compressed
about the trunk, it does not interfere with the walls of a house nor
obstruct the windows.

No wood equal to our black ash for oars, so pliant and elastic
and strong, second only to hickory for handspikes; used also for
chair-bottoms and riddles.

The French call the nettle-tree _bois inconnu_.

Our white elm (_Ulmus Americana_) “the most magnificent vegetable of
the temperate zone.”

The _Pinus mitis_, yellow pine, or spruce pine, or short-leaved pine. A
two-leaved pine widely diffused, but not found northward beyond certain
districts of Connecticut and Massachusetts. In New Jersey fifty or
sixty feet high and fifteen to eighteen inches in diameter. Sometimes
three leaves on fresh shoots; smallest of pine cones; seeds cast first
year. Very excellent wood for houses, masts, decks, yards, beams, and
cabins, next in durability to the long-leaved pine. Called at Liverpool
New York pine. Its regular branches make it to be called spruce pine
sometimes.

_Pinus australis_, or long-leaved pine, an invaluable tree, called
yellow pine, pitch pine, and broom pine where it grows; in the North,
Southern pine and red pine; in England, Georgia pitch pine. First
appears at Norfolk, Virginia; thence stretches six hundred miles
southwest. Sixty or seventy feet high, by fifteen to eighteen inches;
leaves a foot long, three in a sheath; negroes use them for brooms.
Being stronger, more compact and durable, because the resin is equally
distributed, and also fine-grained and susceptible of a bright polish,
it is preferred to every other pine. In naval architecture, most
esteemed of all pines,—keels, beams, side-planks, trunnels, etc. For
decks preferred to yellow pine,—and flooring houses. Sold for more
at Liverpool than any other pine. Moreover it supplies nearly all the
resinous matter used and exported. Others which contain much pitch are
more dispersed. At present (1819) this business is confined to North
Carolina.

M. says the branches of resinous trees consist almost wholly of
_wood_, of which the organization is even more perfect than in the
body of the tree. They use dead wood for the tar, etc., in which it has
accumulated.

Says the vicinity of Brunswick, Me., and Burlington, Vt., are the most
northerly limits of the pitch pine or _P. rigida_. (I saw what I should
have called a pitch pine at Montmorency.)

White pine (_P. Strobus_) most abundant between forty-third and
forty-seventh degrees, one hundred and eighty feet by seven and
eight twelfths the largest. “The loftiest and most valuable” of the
productions of the New Hampshire forest.

The black spruce is called _épinette noire_ and _épinette à la bière_
in Canada. From its strength best substitute for oak and larch. Used
here for rafters and preferred to hemlock; tougher than white pine, but
more liable to crack.

The white spruce (_Abies alba_) called _épinette blanche_ in Canada.
Not so large as the last and wood inferior.

Hemlock spruce (_Abies Canadensis_) called _pérusse_ in Canada. In
Maine, Vermont, and upper New Hampshire, three fourths of the evergreen
woods, the rest being black spruce. Belongs to cold regions; begins
to appear about Hudson’s Bay. Its fibre makes the circuit of stocks
fifteen or twenty inches in diameter in ascending five or six feet.
Old trees have their circles separated, and the boards are _shaky_.
Decays rapidly when exposed to the air. It is firmer, though coarser,
than the white pine; affords tighter hold to nails. Used in Maine for
threshing-floors, resisting indentation. Most common use sheathing of
houses, to be covered with clapboards. Used for laths.

White cedar (_Cupressus thyoides_). “The perfect wood resists the
succession of dryness and moisture longer than that of any other
species;” hence for shingles.

Larch (_Larix Americana_); in Canada _épinette rouge_; _tamarack_ by
the Dutch. Male aments appear before the leaves. Wood superior to any
pine or spruce in strength and durability. Used in Maine for knees.

Cedar of Lebanon (_Larix cedrus_) largest and most majestic of resinous
trees of the Old World and one of the finest vegetable productions of
the globe.

Cedar Island in Lake Champlain northern limit of red cedar (_Juniperus
Virginiana_). Eastward, not beyond Wiscasset. Seeds mature at beginning
of fall and _sown at once_; shoot next spring. Gin made from them.

Arbor-vitæ (_Thuya occidentalis_), the only species of _Thuya_ in the
New World. Lake St. John in Canada its northern limit; abounds between
48° 50´ and 45°. The posts last thirty-five or forty years, and the
rails sixty, or three or four times as long as those of any other
species. In northern New England States the best for fences; last
longer in clay than sand.

The superiority of mahogany in the fineness of its grain and its
hardness, which make it susceptible of a brilliant polish. Native trees
in Northern States used in cabinet making are black, yellow, and canoe
birches, red-flowering curled maple, bird’s-eye maple, wild cherry, and
sumach.

The circle[s] of peck and other measures made at Hingham of black, red,
or gray oak are “always of a dull blue color, produced by the gallic
acid of the wood acting upon the iron vessel in which it is boiled.”

White ash used for sieve rims, rake heads and handles, scythe handles,
pulleys, etc. Rake teeth of the mockernut hickory.

In New York and Philadelphia “the price [of wood for fuel][168] nearly
equals and sometimes exceeds that of the best wood in Paris, though
this immense capital annually requires more than 300,000 cords, and is
surrounded to the distance of 300 miles by cultivated plains.” Said in
book of 1819.


_May 19._ Found the _Arum triphyllum_ and the nodding trillium, or
wake-robin, in Conant’s Swamp. An ash also in bloom there, and the
sassafras quite striking. Also the fringed polygala by Conantum wood.

Sinclair says the hornbeam is called “swamp beech” in Vermont.


_May 20. Tuesday._ There is, no doubt, a perfect analogy between the
life of the human being and that of the vegetable, both of the body and
the mind. The botanist Gray says:—

“The organs of plants are of two sorts:—1. Those of _Vegetation_,
which are concerned in growth,—by which the plant takes in the aërial
and earthy matters on which it lives, and elaborates them into the
materials of its own organized substance; 2. Those of _Fructification_
or _Reproduction_, which are concerned with the propagation of the
species.”

So is it with the human being. I am concerned first to come to my
_Growth_, intellectually and morally (and physically, of course, as
a means to this, for the body is the symbol of the soul), and then to
bear my _Fruit_, do my _Work_, _propagate_ my kind, not only physically
but _morally_, not only in body but in mind.

“The organs of vegetation are the _Root_, _Stem_, and _Leaves_. The
_Stem_ is the axis and original basis of the plant.”

“The first point of the stem preëxists in the embryo (_i. e._ in the
rudimentary plantlet contained within the seed): it is here called the
radicle.” Such is the rudiment of mind, already partially developed,
more than a bud, but pale, having never been exposed to the light, and
slumbering coiled up, packed away in the seed, unfolded [_sic_].

Consider the still pale, rudimentary, infantine, radicle-like thoughts
of some students, which who knows what they might expand to, if they
should ever come to the light and air, if they do not become rancid and
perish in the seed. It is not every seed that will survive a thousand
years. Other thoughts further developed, but yet pale and languid, like
shoots grown in a cellar.

“The plant ... develops from the first in two opposite directions,
_viz._ upwards [to expand in the light and air] to produce and continue
the stem (or _ascending axis_), and downwards [avoiding the light][169]
to form the root (or _descending_ axis). The former is ordinarily or in
great part aërial, the latter subterranean.”

So the mind develops from the first in two opposite directions: upwards
to expand in the light and air; and downwards avoiding the light to
form the root. One half is aërial, the other subterranean. The mind
is not well balanced and firmly planted, like the oak, which has not
as much root as branch, whose roots like those of the white pine are
slight and near the surface. One half of the mind’s development must
still be root,—in the embryonic state, in the womb of nature, more
unborn than at first. For each successive new idea or bud, a new
rootlet in the earth. The growing man penetrates yet deeper by his
roots into the womb of things. The infant is comparatively near the
surface, just covered from the light; but the man sends down a tap-root
to the centre of things.

The mere logician, the mere reasoner, who weaves his arguments as
a tree its branches in the sky,—nothing equally developed in the
roots,—is overthrown by the first wind.

As with the roots of the plant, so with the roots of the mind, the
branches and branchlets of the root “are mere repetitions for the
purpose of multiplying the absorbing points, which are chiefly the
growing or newly formed extremities, sometimes termed _spongelets_. It
bears no other organs.”

So this organ of the mind’s development, the _Root_, bears no organs
but spongelets or absorbing points.

Annuals, which perish root and all the first season, especially have
slender and thread-like fibrous roots. But biennials are particularly
characterized by distended, fleshy roots containing starch, a stock
for future growth, to be consumed during their second or flowering
season,—as carrots, radishes, turnips. Perennials frequently have
many thickened roots clustered together, tuberous or palmate roots,
fasciculated or clustered as in the dahlia, pæony, etc.

Roots may spring from any part of the stem under favorable
circumstances; “that is to say in darkness and moisture, as when
covered by the soil or resting on its surface.”

That is, the most clear and ethereal ideas (Antæus-like) readily ally
themselves to the earth, to the primal womb of things. They put forth
roots as soon as branches; they are eager to be _soiled_. No thought
soars so high that it sunders these apron-strings of its mother.
The thought that comes to light, that pierces the empyrean on the
other side, is wombed and rooted in darkness, a moist and fertile
darkness,—its roots in Hades like the tree of life. No idea is so
soaring but it will readily put forth roots. Wherever there is an
air-and-light-seeking bud about to expand, it may become in the earth
a darkness-seeking root. Even swallows and birds-of-paradise _can_ walk
on the ground. To quote the sentence from Gray entire: “Roots not only
spring from the root-end of the primary stem in germination, but also
from any subsequent part of the stem under favorable circumstances,
that is to say, in darkness and moisture, as when covered by the soil
or resting on its surface.”

No thought but is connected as strictly as a flower, with the
earth. The mind flashes not so far on one side but its rootlets, its
spongelets, find their way instantly on the other side into a moist
darkness, uterine,—a low bottom in the heavens, even miasma-exhaling to
such immigrants as are not acclimated. A cloud is uplifted to sustain
its roots. Imbosomed in clouds as in a chariot, the mind drives through
the boundless fields of space. Even there is the dwelling of Indra.

I might here quote the following, with the last—of roots: “They may
even strike in the open air and light, as is seen in the copious aërial
rootlets by which the Ivy, the Poison Ivy, and the Trumpet Creeper
climb and adhere to the trunks of trees or other bodies; and also in
Epiphytes or Air-plants, of most warm regions, which have no connection
whatever with the soil, but germinate and grow high in air on the
trunks or branches of trees, etc.; as well as in some terrestrial
plants, such as the Banian and Mangrove, that send off aërial roots
from their trunks or branches, which finally reach the ground.”

So, if our light-and-air-seeking tendencies extend too widely for our
original root or stem, we must send downward new roots to ally us to
the earth.

Also there are parasitic plants which have their roots in the branches
or roots of other trees, as the mistletoe, the beech-drops, etc. There
are minds which so have their roots in other minds as in the womb of
nature,—if, indeed, most are not such?!


_May 21. Wednesday._ Yesterday I made out the black and the white
ashes. A double male white ash in Miles’s Swamp, and two black ashes
with sessile leaflets. A female white ash near railroad, in Stow’s
land. The white ashes by Mr. Pritchard’s have no blossoms, at least as
yet.

If I am right, the _black_ ash is improperly so called, from the color
of its bark being lighter than the white. Though it answers to the
description in other respects, even to the elder-like odor of the
leaves, I should like still to see a description of the yellow ash
which grows in made [_sic_].

The day before yesterday I found the male sassafras in abundance but no
female.

The leaves of my new pine on Merriam’s or Pine Hill are of intermediate
length between those of the yellow pine and the Norway pine. I can
find no cone to distinguish the tree by; but, as the leaves are
_semicylindrical_ and not _hollowed_ I think it must be the red
or Norway Pine, though it does not look very red, and is _spruce_!
answering perhaps to the description of the yellow pine, which is
sometimes called spruce pine.

To-day examined the flowers of the _Nemopanthes Canadensis_,—a genus of
a single species, says Emerson. It bears the beautiful crimson velvety
berry of the swamps, and is what I have heard called the cornel. Common
name wild holly.

       *       *       *       *       *

I have heard now within a few days that peculiar dreaming sound of the
frogs[170] which belongs to the summer,—their midsummer night’s dream.

Only that thought and that expression are good which are musical.

I think that we are not commonly aware that man is our
contemporary,—that in this strange, outlandish world, so barren, so
prosaic, fit not to live in but merely to pass through, that even here
so divine a creature as man does actually live. Man, the crowning fact,
the god we know. While the earth supports so rare an inhabitant, there
is somewhat to cheer us. Who shall say that there is no God, if there
is a _just_ man. It is only within a year that it has occurred to me
that there is such a being actually existing on the globe. Now that I
perceive that it is so, many questions assume a new aspect. We have not
only the idea and vision of the divine ourselves, but we have brothers,
it seems, who have this idea also. Methinks my neighbor is better than
I, and his thought is better than mine. There is a representative of
the divinity on earth, of [whom] all things fair and noble are to
be expected. We have the material of heaven here. I think that the
standing miracle to man is man. Behind the paling yonder, come rain
or shine, hope or doubt, there dwells a man, an actual being who can
sympathize with our sublimest thoughts.

The revelations of nature are infinitely glorious and cheering, hinting
to us of a remote future, of possibilities untold; but startlingly near
to us some day we find a fellow-man.

The frog had eyed the heavens from his marsh, until his mind was filled
with visions, and he saw more than belongs to this fenny earth. He
mistrusted that he was become a dreamer and visionary. Leaping across
the swamp to his fellow, what was his joy and consolation to find that
he too had seen the same sights in the heavens, he too had dreamed the
same dreams!

From nature we turn astonished to this _near_ but supernatural fact.

I think that the existence of man in nature is the divinest and most
startling of all facts. It is a fact which few have realized.

I can go to my neighbors and meet on ground as elevated as we could
expect to meet upon if we were now in heaven.

                             “And we live,
     We of this mortal mixture, in the same law
     As the pure colorless intelligence
     Which dwells in Heaven, and the dead Hadean shades.”

I do not think that man can understand the _importance_ of man’s
existence, its bearing on the other phenomena of life, until it shall
become a remembrance to him the survivor that such a being or such a
race once existed on the earth. Imagine yourself alone in the world,
a musing, wondering, reflecting spirit, _lost_ in thought, and imagine
thereafter the creation of man!—man made in the image of God!

Looking into a book on dentistry the other day, I observed a list of
authors who had written on this subject. There were Ran and Tan and
Yungerman, and I was impressed by the fact that there was nothing in
a name. It was as if they had been named by the child’s rigmarole of
_Iery [wiery] ichery van, tittle-tol-tan_, etc. I saw in my mind a herd
of wild creatures swarming over the earth, and to each one its own
herdsman had affixed some barbarous name, or sound, or syllables, in
his own dialect,—so in a thousand languages. Their names were seen to
be as meaningless exactly as Bose or Tray, the names of dogs.[171] Men
get named no better.

We seem to be distinct ourselves, never repeated, and yet we bear
no names which express a proportionate distinctness; they are quite
accidental. Take away their names, and you leave men a wild herd,
distinguished only by their individual qualities. It is as if you were
to give names in the Caffre dialect to the individuals in a herd of
spring-boks or gnus.

We have but few patronymics, but few Christian names, in proportion
to the number of us. Is it that men ceased to be original when genuine
and original names ceased to be given. Have we not enough character to
establish a new patronymic.

Methinks it would be some advantage to philosophy if men were _named_
merely in the gross, as they are known. It would only be necessary to
know the genus and, perchance, the species and variety, to know the
individual.

I will not allow _mere names_ to make distinctions for me, but still
see men in herds for all _them_. A familiar name cannot make a man less
strange to me. It may be given to a savage who retains in secret his
own wild title earned in the woods. I see that the neighbor who wears
the familiar epithet of William or Edwin takes it off with his jacket.
It does not adhere to him when asleep or when in anger, or aroused by
any passion or inspiration. I seem to hear pronounced by some of his
kin at such a time his original wild name in some jaw-breaking or else
melodious tongue. As the names of the Poles and Russians are to us, so
are ours to them.

Our names are as cheap as the names given to dogs. We know what are
dogs’ names; we know what are men’s names. Sometimes it would be
significant and truer, it would lead to generalization, it would avoid
exaggeration, to say, “_There was a man_ who said or did—,” instead of
designating him by some familiar, but perchance delusive, name.

We hardly believe that every private soldier in a Roman army had a name
of his own.[172]

It is interesting to see how the names of famous men are repeated,—even
of great poets and philosophers. The poet is not known to-day even by
his neighbors to be more than a common man. He is perchance the butt
of many. The proud farmer looks down [on] and boorishly ignores him,
or regards him as a loafer who treads down his grass, but perchance
in course of time the poet will have so succeeded that some of the
farmer’s posterity, though equally boorish with their ancestor, will
bear the poet’s name. The boor names his boy Homer, and so succumbs
unknowingly to the bard’s victorious fame. Anything so fine as poetic
genius he cannot more directly recognize. The unpoetic farmer names his
child Homer.

You have a wild savage in you, and a savage name is perchance somewhere
recorded as yours.[173]


_May 23. Friday._ And wilder still there grows elsewhere, I hear,
a native and aboriginal crab-apple, _Malus_ (as Michaux, or, as
Emerson has it, _Pyrus_) _coronaria_ in Southern States, and also
_angustifolia_ in the Middle States; whose young leaves “have a
bitter and slightly aromatic taste” (Michaux), whose beautiful flowers
perfume the air to a great distance. “The apples ... are small, green,
intensely acid, and very odoriferous. Some farmers make cider of them,
which is said to be excellent: they make very fine sweet-meats also,
by the addition of a large quantity of sugar” (Michaux). Celebrated
for “the beauty of its flowers, and for the sweetness of its perfume”
(Michaux).[174]

Michaux says that the wild apple of Europe has yielded to cultivation
nearly three hundred species in France alone. Emerson says, referring
to Loudon, “In 1836, the catalogue and the gardens of the London
Horticultural Society contained upwards of 1400 distinct sorts, and new
ones are every year added.”

But here are species which they have not in their catalogue, not to
mention the varieties which the crab might yield to cultivation.[175]

This genus, so kind to the human race, the _Malus_ or _Pyrus_;
_Rosaceæ_ the family, or others say _Pomaceæ_. Its flowers are perhaps
the most beautiful of any tree. I am frequently compelled to turn
and linger by some more than usually beautiful two-thirds-expanded
blossoms.[176] If such were not so common, its fame would be loud as
well as wide. Its most copious and delicious blossoms.

But our wild apple is wild perchance like myself, who belong not to
the aboriginal race here, but have strayed into the woods from the
cultivated stock,[177]—where the birds, where winged thoughts or
agents, have planted or are planting me. Even these at length furnish
hardy stocks for the orchard.

You might call one _Malus oculata_; another _M. Iridis_; _M. cum
parvuli dæmonis oculis_, or Imp-eyed; Blue-Jay Apple, or _M. corvi
cristati_; Wood-Dell Apple (_M. silvestri-vallis_); Field-Dell Apple
(_M. campestri-vallis_); Meadow Apple (_M. pratensis_); Rock Meadow
Apple (_saxopratensis_); Partridge or Grouse Apple or bud [_sic_];
Apple of the Hesperides (_Malus Hesperidum_); Woodside Apple;
Wood Apple (_M. silvatica_); the Truant’s Apple (_M. cessatoris_);
Saunterer’s Apple (_M. erronis vel vagabundi_); the Wayside Apple
(_M. trivialis_); Beauty of the Air (_decus aëris_); December-eating;
Frozen-thawed (_gelato-soluta_ or _gelata regelata_); the Concord Apple
(_M. Concordiensis_); the Brindled Apple; Wine of New England (_M.
vinosa_); the Chickaree Apple; the Green Apple (_M. viridis_); the
Dysentery or Cholera-morbus Apple.[178]

Distinctly related things are strangely near in _fact_, brush one
another with their jackets. Perchance this window-seat in which we sit
discoursing Transcendentalism, with only Germany and Greece stretching
behind our minds, was made so deep because this was a few years ago a
garrison-house, with thick log walls, bullet-proof, behind which men
sat to escape the wild red man’s bullet and the arrow and the tomahawk,
and bullets fired by Indians are now buried in its walls. Pythagoras
seems near compared with them.


_May 24. Saturday._ Our most glorious experiences are a kind of regret.
Our regret is so sublime that we may mistake it for triumph. It is
the painful, plaintively sad surprise of our Genius remembering our
past lives and contemplating what is possible. It is remarkable that
men commonly never refer to, never hint at, any crowning experiences
when the common laws of their being were unsettled and the divine and
eternal laws prevailed in them. Their lives are not revolutionary; they
never recognize any other than the local and temporal authorities. It
is a regret so divine and inspiring, so genuine, based on so true and
distinct a contrast, that it surpasses our proudest boasts and the
fairest expectations.

My most sacred and memorable life is commonly on awaking in the
morning. I frequently awake with an atmosphere about me as if my
unremembered dreams had been divine, as if my spirit had journeyed to
its native place, and, in the act of reëntering its native body, had
diffused an elysian fragrance around.

The Genius says: “Ah! That is what you were! That is what you may yet
be!” It is glorious for us to be able to regret even such an existence.

A sane and growing man revolutionizes every day. What institutions of
man can survive a morning experience? A single night’s sleep, if we
have indeed slumbered and forgotten anything and grown in our sleep,
puts them behind us like the river Lethe. It is no unusual thing for
him to see the kingdoms of this world pass away.[179]

       *       *       *       *       *

It is an interesting inquiry to seek for the medicines which will
cure our ails in the plants which grow around us. At first we are not
disposed to believe that man and plants are so intimately related. Very
few plants have been medically examined. And yet this is the extent
of most men’s botany; and it is more extensive than would at first be
supposed. The botanist is startled by some countryman’s familiarity
with an obscure plant to him rare and strange. He, who has been an
observer for some years, knows not what it is, but the unobserving
countryman, who sees nothing but what is thrust upon him, or the old
woman who rarely goes out of the house, shows an easy familiarity with
it and can call it by name.

I am struck by the fact that, though any important individual
experience is rare, though it is so rare that the individual is
conscious of a relation to his maker transcending time and space and
earth, though any knowledge of, or communication from, “Providence”
is the rarest thing in the world, yet men very easily, regarding
themselves in the gross, speak of carrying out the designs of
Providence as nations. How often the Saxon man talks of carrying out
the designs of Providence, as if he had some knowledge of Providence
and His designs. Men allow themselves to associate Providence and
designs of Providence with their dull, prosaic, every-day thoughts
of things. That language is usurped by the stalest and deadest
prose, which can only report the most choice poetic experience. This
“Providence” is the stalest jest in the universe. The office-boy sweeps
out his office “by the leave of Providence.”


_May 25._ A fine, freshening air, a little hazy, that bathes and washes
everything, saving the day from extreme heat. Walked to the hills south
of Wayland by the road by Deacon Farrar’s. First vista just beyond
Merron’s (?), looking west down a valley, with a verdant-columned elm
at the extremity of the vale and the blue hills and horizon beyond.
These are the resting-places in a walk. We love to see any part of the
earth tinged with blue, cerulean, the color of the sky, the celestial
color. I wonder that houses are not oftener located mainly that they
may command particular rare prospects, every convenience yielding to
this. The farmer would never suspect what it was you were buying, and
such sites would be the cheapest of any. A site where you might avail
yourself of the art of Nature for three thousand years, which could
never be materially changed or taken from you, a noble inheritance
for your children. The true sites for human dwellings are unimproved.
They command no price in the market. Men will pay something to look
into a travelling showman’s box, but not to look upon the fairest
prospects on the earth. A vista where you have the near green horizon
contrasted with the distant blue one, terrestrial with celestial earth.
The prospect of a vast horizon must be accessible in our neighborhood.
Where men of enlarged views may be educated. An unchangeable kind of
wealth, a _real_ estate.

There we found the celandine in blossom and the _Ranunculus bulbosus_,
which we afterwards saw _double_ in Wayland, having nine petals.

The _Pyrus arbutifolia_, variety _melanocarpa_. Gray makes also the
variety _erythrocarpa_. Is this the late red choke-berry of the swamps?
and is the former the earlier black one of the swamps?

By Farrar’s the _Nepeta Glechoma_, a kind of mint. Linnæus calls it
_Glechoma hederacea_. Looks somewhat like catnep.

The marsh-marigold, _Caltha palustris_, improperly called cowslip.

The white oak, _Quercus alba_. And the commonest scrub oak, the bear or
black oak, _Q. ilicifolia_.

The chinquapin, or dwarf chestnut, oak, the smallest of our oaks, _Q.
prinoides_.

The _Cratægus coccinea_ (?), or scarlet-fruited thorn (?)

Another glorious vista with a wide horizon at the yellow Dutch house,
just over the Wayland line, by the black spruce, heavy and dark as
night, which we could see two or three miles as a landmark. Now at
least, before the deciduous trees have fully expanded their leaves, it
is remarkably black. It is more stoutly and irregularly branched than
Holbrook’s spruces—has a much darker foliage; but the cone scales of
both are slightly waved or notched. Are they, then, both black spruce?
The cones are enough like, and the thickness of the leaves; their
color enough unlike. Here is a view of the Jenkins house, the fish-pole
house, and Wachusett beyond.

Noticed what I think must be a young poison sumach[180] abundant by the
roadside in woods, with last year’s berries, with small greenish-yellow
flowers, but leaves not pinnatifid, three together; from one to two
feet high. What is it?

_Alnus serrulata_, the common alder, with a grayish stem, leaves smooth
on both sides.

_Alnus incana_, the speckled alder, downy on under side of leaves.

The hard-berried plant seems to be _Andromeda ligustrina_ (?) of Gray,
_A. paniculata_ of Bigelow, _Lyonia paniculata_ of Emerson.

Thyme-leaved veronica, little bluish-white, streak-petalled flower by
road sides. _Silene Pennsylvanica._

What is the orange-yellow aster-like flower of the meadows now in
blossom with a sweet-smelling stem when bruised?[181]

What the delicate pinkish and yellowish flower with hoary-green stem
and leaves, of rocky hills.[182]

Saw Bunker Hill Monument and Charlestown from the Wayland hills, and
across the valleys to Milton Hill.[183] Westward, or west by south,
an island in a pond or in the river (!which see!) A grand horizon.
Probably saw the elm between Wayland and Weston which is seen so far
in the horizon from the northwest part of Sudbury. A good, a rare place
this must be to view the Sudbury or Wayland meadows a little earlier.

Came back across lots to the black spruce.

Now, at 8.30 o’clock P. M., I hear the dreaming of the frogs.[184] So
it seems to me, and so significantly passes my life away. It is like
the dreaming of frogs in a summer evening.


_May 27._ I saw an organ-grinder this morning before a rich man’s
house, thrilling the street with harmony, loosening the very
paving-stones and tearing the routine of life to rags and tatters, when
the lady of the house shoved up a window and in a semiphilanthropic
tone inquired if he wanted anything to eat. But he, very properly it
seemed to me, kept on grinding and paid no attention to her question,
feeding her ears with melody unasked for. So the world shoves up its
window and interrogates the poet, and sets him to gauging ale casks in
return. It seemed to me that the music suggested that the recompense
should be as fine as the gift. It would be much nobler to enjoy the
music, though you paid no money for it, than to presume always a
beggarly relation. It is after all, perhaps, the best instrumental
music that we have.


_May 28._ The trees now begin to shade the streets. When the sun
gets high in the sky the trees give shade. With oppressive heats come
refreshing shadows.

The buttercups spot the churchyard.


_May 29._ It is evident that the virtues of plants are almost
completely unknown to us, and we esteem the few with which we are
better acquainted unreasonably above the many which are comparatively
unknown to us. Bigelow says: “It is a subject of some curiosity to
consider, if the knowledge of the present Materia Medica were by any
means to be lost, how many of the same articles would again rise
into notice and use. Doubtless a variety of new substances would
develop unexpected powers, while perhaps the poppy would be shunned
as a deleterious plant, and the cinchona might grow unmolested upon
the mountains of Quito.” Sawyer regards _Nux vomica_ among the most
valuable. B. says (1817): “We have yet to discover our anodynes and
our emetics, although we abound in bitters, astringents, aromatics,
and demulcents. In the present state of our knowledge we could not
well dispense with opium and ipecacuanha, yet a great number of foreign
drugs, such as gentian, columbo, chamomile, kino, catechu, cascarilla,
canella, etc., for which we pay a large annual tax to other countries,
might in all probability be superseded by the indigenous products of
our own. It is certainly better that our own country people should have
the benefit of collecting such articles, than that we should pay for
them to the Moors of Africa, or the Indians of Brazil.”

The thorn-apple (_Datura Stramonium_) (apple of Peru, devil’s-apple,
Jamestown-weed) “emigrates with great facility, and often springs
up in the ballast of ships, and in earth carried from one country to
another.” It secretes itself in the hold of vessels and migrates. It
is a sort of cosmopolitan weed, a roving weed. What adventures! What
historian knows when first it came into a country! He quotes Beverly’s
“History of Virginia” as saying that some soldiers in the days of
Bacon’s rebellion, having eaten some of this plant, which was boiled
for salad by mistake, were made natural fools and buffoons by it for
eleven days, without injury to their bodies (? ?).

The root of a biennial or perennial will accumulate the virtues of the
plant more than any other part.

B. says that Pursh states that the sweet-scented goldenrod (_Solidago
odora_) “has for some time [_i. e._ before 1817][185] been an article
of exportation to China, where it fetches a high price.” And yet it is
known to very few New-Englanders.

“No botanist,” says B., “even if in danger of starving in a wilderness,
would indulge his hunger on a root or fruit taken from an unknown
plant of the natural order _Luridæ_, of the _Multisiliquæ_, or the
_umbelliferous aquatics_. On the contrary he would not feel a moment’s
hesitation in regard to any of the _Gramina_, the fruit of the
_Pomaceæ_ and several other natural families of plants, which are known
to be uniformly innocent in their effects.”

The aromatic flavor of the checkerberry is also perceived in the
_Gaultheria hispidula_, in _Spiræa ulmaria_ and the root of _Spiræa
lobata_, and in the birches.

He says ginseng, spigelia, snake-root, etc., form considerable articles
of exportation.

The odor of skunk-cabbage is perceived in some North American currants,
as _Ribes rigens_ of Michaux on high mountains.

At one time the Indians about Quebec and Montreal were so taken up
with searching for ginseng that they could not be hired for any other
purpose. It is said that both the Chinese and the Indians named this
plant from its resemblance to the figure of a man.[186]

The Indians use the bark of _Dirca palustris_, or leather-wood,
for their cordage. It was after the long-continued search of many
generations that these qualities were discovered.

Of tobacco (_Nicotiana Tabacum_) B. says, after speaking of its
poisonous qualities: “Yet the first person who had courage and patience
enough to persevere in its use, until habit had overcome his original
disgust, eventually found in it a pleasing sedative, a soother of
care, and a material addition to the pleasures of life. Its use, which
originated among savages, has spread into every civilized country;
it has made its way against the declamations of the learned, and the
prohibitions of civil and religious authority, and it now gives rise
to an extensive branch of agriculture, or of commerce, in every part of
the globe.” Soon after its introduction into Europe, “the rich indulged
in it as a luxury of the highest kind; and the poor gave themselves
up to it, as a solace for the miseries of life.” Several varieties are
cultivated.

In return for many foreign weeds, we have sent abroad, says B., “the
_Erigeron Canadensis_ and the prolific families of _Ambrosia_ and
_Amaranthus_.”

“The Indians were acquainted with the medicinal properties of more than
one species of Euphorbia.”

I noticed the button-bush, May 25th, around an elevated pond or
mud-hole, its leaves just beginning to expand. This slight amount of
green contrasted with its dark, craggly [_sic_], naked-looking stem and
branches—as if subsiding waters had left them bare—looked Dantesque and
infernal. It is not a handsome bush at this season, it is so slow to
put out its leaves and hide its naked and unsightly stems.

The _Andromeda ligustrina_ is late to leave out.

_May 30. Friday._ There was a Concord man once who had a foxhound named
Burgoyne. He called him Bug_īne_. A good name.[189]


_May 31._ _Pedestrium solatium in apricis locis; nodosa._[190]
